 'preciate it.
 Cal, buddy, please tell me she's not gonna use my spoon to raise the dead.
 Do not concern yourself with a missing artifact. I'll deal with it personally.
 Dodge this!
 Guess that's over. 
 How'd you...?
 I just saw him. 
 I see an intruder! Up there!
 I won't falter!
 I-I'll get you!
 Jedi coward. 
 Just a child with a lightsaber. 
 No lift platform here.
 Not yet, Jedi
 Others will take him. Patience, Brothers.
 This relic is the key to the vault on Bogano.
 Time to die, scum!
 W-what?
 What a sight, eh?
 Yes! Fall!
 Yes. Wyyyschokk.
'Fraid?
'scuse me.

*sigh*
... a warning?
... like I said. Don't get too close. We'll be fine.
...and after that smell, I don't think I want to.
...but is power the answer?
...but will this power makes you victorious?
...over there.
...take your lightsaber and free the Wookiees inside. We'll need their help to stop the Empire.
...that means requisition forms. What a hassle.
...the hell?!
...yet you still rely on the same methods.
A Bracca scrap rat playing Jedi?
A Jedi I knew discovered it before the Purge.
A Jedi did some damage there.
A Jedi is near. 
A Jedi named Eno Cordova hid something inside of it.
A Jedi was spotted on Zeffo.
A Jedi!
A Jedi! And he's weak!
A Jedi!? Stay sharp.
A Jedi, here?! Sealing the passage.
A Jedi. This is what I've trained for.
A Jedi...
A Jedi?
A Jedi? After him. 
A Jedi? Must bring back tough memories.
A Nightsister survived. Something about her is... familiar?
A Nightsister used this bowl for mixing potions and elixirs. Some were medicine, others poison.
A Nightsister, she raised the dead! They're after me!
A Nightsister.
A Nightsister... practicing her craft.
A Padawan survived the crash. He was looking for his master.
A Purge Trooper complimented me recently.
A Purge Trooper. Their only purpose is to hunt Jedi.
A Rigger with a family?
A Stormtrooper used these while scouting the area. Looks like he may have found a way into the tomb.
A Venator? In this part of the galaxy? It must have gone down during the Clone Wars.
A Wookiee Chieftain named Tarfful.
A Wookiee chieftain. They were old friends.
A Wookiee is dangerous. They can split a man in half. To me, a kill is a kill, stormtrooper.
A Wookiee slave collar.
A Wookiee took shelter here, mourning the loss of an Elder.
A Wookiee used these to watch the Empire enslave their people.
A Youngling dropped this during her test. She was so scared of failing. Brings back some memories.
A Zeffonian skull. Killed in some kind of horrifying disaster long ago.
A beautiful masterpiece of a machine. You really sold it to her, huh Greez?
A big loan, actually.
A blaster does just what I need it to.
A bogling. There must be a nest around here somewhere.
A broken droid.
A built-in escape plan if this didn't work out.
A bunch of screw ups.
A child at play...
A contrast from the ostentatious Tomb of Miktrull... yet not a welcome one.
A coward's defense. 
A crashed ship. I think it was a Republic Venator.
A crime syndicate ship?
A decent defense.
A depiction of Miktrull at the Vault on Bogano - you can see the object in their hand.
A disappointing opening, but the endgame proved satisfying.
A disturbance...
A failure on his part.
A feeble attempt.
A feeble display!
A few extra credits couldn't hurt, y'know?
A few more hits.
A few more to finish this. 
A few rotations ago, my people searched an abandoned Wookiee village nearby.
A few things broke here and there, so... I needed some fast money.
A few times, but never far.
A finder's fee like this could be your ticket off this soggy rock.
A fine test of skill. 
A fitting end to a cowardly padawan.
A fitting end!
A foe approaches!
A foe approaches. 
A futile effort.
A game which requires credits. Strange choice.
A glancing blow. 
A great Jedi meditated here. He returned at points throughout his life to contemplate his many adventures and trials.
A grisly death...
A healing stim?
A holocron from the Archives.
A holocron.
A jotaz! Finally, a worthy opponent. 
A jotaz. Great.
A keepsake. It's survived more battles than anyone should fight.
A laughable response!
A lightsaber? Here? I don't get it...
A limb's easy.
A little busy!
A little help here?
A little help, BD?
A little help, bud!
A little help, buddy.
A little help?
A little much, don't you think?
A long time ago. I was his apprentice.
A lost Padawan. How tragic.
A lot of people risking their lives here.
A mild threat. 
A miss.
A misstep.
A mistake. 
A mother used this fabric to keep her child warm. They were on the run from something.
A mykal approaches.
A near miss. 
A new day is upon us. 
A noise there. 
A noise. Over there. 
A noise. There. 
A one on one fight? Let's do it then.
A path by the gate?
A path forward.
A phillak hit me the other day. Now my ankle is making this weird clicking noise. 
A place for young Force-users to test their beliefs. To learn how to trust in the Force and the Jedi.
A place like this can make anyone feel uneasy.
A poor show of skill.
A pretty great one.
A probe droid processing unit!
A real Jedi wouldn't run.
A relic from the ancient Zeffo. I sense great vanity and extravagance in this period of their history.
A report came in this morning that he's been seen in the Shadowlands. 
A ritual.
A ritual. It will hide the ship.
A rope hold?
A sacrifice. One of your arms will do nicely.
A sandstorm!
A scant mercy.
A scomp link?
A scrapyard on Bracca, but we rooted him out. It was only a matter of time.
A shameful display.
A ship crashed. They were fleeing from something.
A ship is leaving the platform! Do you see this?
A shortcut?
A shortcut? That's why you wanted to move this thing.
A skilled fighter. 
A solid blow!
A solid hit!
A solid hit. 
A sound. Over there. 
A spark of hope that there could be a future.
A statue, placed with a view of the vault. I sense the site was chosen with great purpose.
A stim crate! Should be... here!
A stim won't help you. Nothing will.
A stim, BD?
A stim? Just drawing it out...
A stormtrooper is down. 
A symbol of the Wookiee resistance, striking at the Empire from the Shadowlands.
A threat comes from below. 
A tie off? We should check around for rope.
A traitor.
A trespasser above us. 
A trespasser!
A trespasser. 
A trespasser. And he's weak. 
A true challenger. 
A tyrant... like Malicos.
A very good friend of mine told me to go out and find my place in the galaxy.
A victory well earned!
A violent display. 
A weak blow!
A weak blow.
A weak blow. 
A weakling.
A wise precaution.
A worker left their tools in a hurry. They were anxious to locate relics, but also careless of the history buried here.
A worthy adversary.
A worthy challenge!
A zipline?
A-above us?
A-alright. 
A-an intruder?
A-avoid the ruin.
AAAAAAaaaaaah!
AHHHH!
ALL the files? You know how long that will take?
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaahh!!!
Aaah!
Aaggh!
About Cordova.
About bugs? C'mon, they're easy kills.
Above positioning isn't your ally.
Above us. 
Above us. The Jedi is here. 
Above!
Above! Eyes above!
Above! He retreats above!
Acknowledged!
Acknowledged.
Acknowledged. Carry on.
Acknowledged. Maintain readiness.
Across the galaxy. Hundreds of worlds.
Additional critter terminated.
Advance on him. 
Advance on the enemy!
Advance on the traitor!
Advance!
Advancing on the enemy.
Adversary down there.
Adversary identified as fragile.
Adversary inbound!
Affirmative blow.
Affirmative!
Affirmative.
Affirmative. 
Affirmative. They're handling the situation.
Affirmative. Will watch for phillak.
Affirmatory.
Affirmed. 
Afraid of a fight?
Afraid of getting hit?
Afraid of getting hit? 
Afraid to face me yourself?
After I lost my family, there was nothing. I was alone on Dathomir.
After I take this Jedi's life, I'm gonna keep his droid as a trophy.
After all the crazy things we've done?
After dodging falling debris in the pitch-black darkness, I managed to avoid detection and basically saved all our lives.
After him before he escapes. 
After him!
After him! After him now!
After him! Now!
After him! Together!
After him.
After him. 
After him. Quick. 
After much study, I've discerned a pattern and begun to translate their language.
After she lost her apprentice to the Empire. She does not talk about her much. 
After the Jedi!
After the Jedi. 
After the Purge...
After the bounty. 
After the insurgent.
After the intruder!
After the mark. 
After the massacre I buried my mothers, my friends... Ilyana.
After the outsider!
After the outsider. 
After the snake. 
After this station, I'm headed on a covert mission with some Purge Troopers.
After we kill this Jedi, will we find and eradicate his supporters?
After we leave, I'm gonna take a long bath.
After what I've seen so far, I can imagine.
After you, kid.
Again! Hit him again!
Again.
Again? I don't know...
Again? Really?
Aggh! Uh!
Aggressor below.
Aggressor roaming.
Agh that hurts...
Agh!
Agh! 
Agh! Close!
Agh! Fire!
Agh! Get back here!
Agh! He went up there!
Agh! He's running away!
Agh! I can't move!
Agh! I need help!
Agh! I won't die here!
Agh! I'll get you!
Agh! I'll make you pay!
Agh! It's gonna blow!
Agh! Keep your heads down!
Agh! Missed!
Agh! My servos!
Agh! No more gunner support.
Agh! No!
Agh! No! 
Agh! No! How?!
Agh! Not so bad!
Agh! That's our ranged support.
Agh! What?
Agh! What?!
Agh! Who cares about rocks and pottery anyway?!
Agh, he's taking a stim!
Agh, what!?
Agh. Stop losing him!
Agh. That last raid by the insurgents left me hurting.
Agreed. I'll radio when we have first sight.
Agreed. Your focus and confidence is admirable. The Jedi will not survive our combined efforts. 
Ah Kashyyyk. Love the humidity.
Ah well, at least the Mantis feels more alive.
Ah what?!
Ah!
Ah! An intruder!
Ah! Don't fall!
Ah! Enemy!
Ah! Flame beetle!
Ah! I can't move!
Ah! I missed!
Ah! I see you up there!
Ah! It's coming!
Ah! Make it stop!
Ah! No!
Ah! No! Wyyyschokk!
Ah! Oh no! Jotaz!
Ah! Okay! I'm done!
Ah! Please don't hurt me!
Ah! So it's true!
Ah! Stop it!
Ah! Watch out!
Ah! Watch your feet!
Ah! We're out of ranged support!
Ah! What's that?
Ah! Who's that?!
Ah, Cordova, you old fool.
Ah, I see you've made some... upgrades.
Ah, I see. You know, you've got a lot more going for you than gambling.
Ah, I'm sure it's nothin'.
Ah, Zeffo. My favorite place. 
Ah, back to normal.
Ah, don't mention it.
Ah, she's holding up fine.
Ah, some finesse. 
Ah, stings a little. 
Ah, story for another time.
Ah... I see now.
Ah... just my ship. The Mantis. Good name, right? Intimidating!
Ahead you will find the inner chamber of the Vault but...
Ahem.
Ahem... hm.
Ahh --
Ahh!
Ahh, you say that every time.
Ahhh!
Aim adjusted.
Aim below. Get the bounty. 
Aim for his legs!
Aim for the neck!
Aim for the sap!
Aim for the wall!
Aim higher. 
Aim true!
Aim! And fire!
Aim! Fire!
Air's cold, stale.
Air's off again... Wait, what's that noise?
Airborne!
Airlock 8 clear.
Alert. Alert.
All I did was make it angry.
All I do know is having a lightsaber isn't what makes you a Jedi.
All Jedi must be eliminated.
All Jedi must die!
All Jedi will perish.

All heavy artillery is down!
All heavy gunners are down...
All heavy gunners down!
All heavy gunners down.

All melee units down. Attempting to change tactics. 
All of the above.
All of us risking our necks for the bosses.
All of you! Watch it!
All of you...
All our rocket troopers are down.
All our rocket units are down!
All outsiders are dangerous. 
All over now.
All over the galaxy. The Empire has destroyed homes, families, and lives. You think you're the only one?
All ranged trooper support down.
All ranged trooper units down!
All ranged troopers are down.
All ranged troopers down!
All ranged troopers down. 
All ranged troopers down. Trying to change tactics
All ranged troopers eliminated. 
All remaining units are ranged only.

All security droids are down.
All security droids eliminated.
All squad members have expired.
All squads on red alert...
All stimmed up? 
All stormtroopers down. 
All systems are functioning properly.
All the more reason to keep your guard up.
All the report says is that they can be overcome with overwhelming force.
All this ice is messing with my thermals.
All units, Jedi is down. Repeat, Jedi's down.
All we can do is maintain position and wait for further orders.
All will fall like this outsider did!
All you have to do is lead the target. Hit 'em every time. 
All you need to know about me is that I consider the eradication of Jedi the greatest pursuit I've ever been a part of.
All you, BD.
Allied unit down.
Ally detection modified.
Ally detection restored.
Ally down!
Almost felt that.
Almost got him.
Almost got it.
Almost got me.
Almost makes me want to fill these walls with music from my hallikset or something.
Almost makes this ship feel like a home.
Almost there. 
Almost there. We can do this. 
Almost. Keep moving. 
Almost...
Alone. Finally. 
Already broken, Jedi?
Already on it. 
Already on mission. 
Alright let's move out!
Alright then, I'll see you later.
Alright we're here. Get in your chair. 
Alright well just be careful.
Alright!
Alright! Again!
Alright! Just you an' me now!
Alright! Let's end it!
Alright! Payday!
Alright! Where to next BD?
Alright, BD-1. Let me get in there.
Alright, BD-1. We got this!
Alright, I'll see if I can find any.
Alright, already!
Alright, alright.
Alright, alright. Let's look.
Alright, clamp is secured.
Alright, get him!
Alright, if you're jumpin' you better do it now, kid!
Alright, kid. Sit down. We're here. 
Alright, let's finish this.
Alright, let's get back to it. 
Alright, let's go.
Alright, let's help these Wookiees get back in the fight.
Alright, let's pick where we go next.
Alright, let's try it.
Alright, maybe I'll listen to you next time.
Alright, rookie. Calm down a little. 
Alright, that's done. Back to patrol.
Alright, well, where are we going? I'm just asking 'cause I was thinking of maybe making some food.
Alright.
Alright. 
Alright. Here we go. 
Alright. I'll give it a little longer. 
Alright. Just you and me.
Alright. Let's check this out. 
Alright. Let's end this. 
Alright. Let's try this again. 
Alright. So, next...
Alright. That's done.
Alright. We're safe now.
Also another test.
Always finding great stuff.
Always finding stuff.
Always looking on the bright side, huh?
Always looking on the bright side. Thanks, buddy.
Always nice to see your sentimental side. But it wasn't 'til Nar Shaddaa that we really started clickin'.
Always on point. 
Always one step behind.
Always positive.
Always something.
Always works for me...
Always.
Am I all that's left?
Am I even close to hitting him? 
Am I seeing things?
Am I the only one gonna fight? 
Am I too much for you?
Am I too much for you? 
Am I... the last one?
Am... am I all that's left?
Amateur.
Amazing...
An Astrium.
An Imperial Inquisitor.
An Imperial Officer hid a valuable relic here.
An Imperial officer was trying to hide a relic down here. There was a cave-in, she became trapped and never escaped.
An abandoned patrol station. This is a dangerous area BD.
An advanced civilization of Force wielders who mysteriously vanished...
An adversary!
An ancient Zeffonian, part of a workforce that helped construct this tomb. They died before the job was finished.
An ancient burial site.
An ancient sphere capable of storing and conducting massive amounts of energy.
An armored warrior brandishing this...
An awkward strike!
An easy bounty!
An enemy below.
An enemy below. 
An enemy is above us!
An enemy!
An enemy! Down there!
An enemy. 
An enemy? Here?
An enforcer from a bygone era.
An error has been detected on line Ten-A. Hauler clamps are jammed.
An error. 
An insurgent! Down there!
An intruder!
An intruder! Above!
An intruder! Down there!
An intruder! Up there!
An intruder. 
An intruder...
An outsider! Down there!
An outsider. 
Analytical swing.
Ancient beyond belief.
Ancient ruins are meaningless, but if it's important to the Jedi, I say we destroy it completely. 
And I am not the same as I was, Cal.
And I am so very sorry.
And I believe in whom you choose to replace me.
And I can teach you how to control its power.
And I gave them Trilla.
And I had a nice chat with the Second Sister.
And I have failed you, Trilla.
And I killed them all.
And I know he's been here.
And I know there's nothing I can do to make that right.
And I know what has to be done. I've done it before.
And I learned a lot. Much of which I taught Trilla.
And I lost all control.
And I make the rules. 
And I need to know that I am doing the best that I can to ensure safety in the galaxy from destructive traitors.
And I tapped...
And I tried pushing it down but there was no hiding from myself.
And I will teach you to control the power?
And I'm not really sure I trust you.
And Malicos was wrong to use that against you.
And a common cause.
And all I wanted to do was die.
And all others.
And as we both know, the Force...
And before that?
And cut down my people.
And did you?
And do not keep me waiting.
And don't forget the Empire fights dirty. Watch your tail in that refinery, kid.
And done!
And drinks!
And engineers...
And for that...
And for years...
And from you.
And gained access to the Vault and this recording. One of many encrypted logs stored in the droid.
And good at getting yourself into trouble. 
And got us closer to the tomb. 
And he takes it down!!
And he was worse than any... nightmare I could have imagined. And I still fought.
And he's gone. 
And if it does?
And if one happens to be a Jedi, I will destroy them.
And if they don't, they'll die.
And if this Jedi attempts to access the tomb, I will devote my life to his death.
And it appears he did.
And it's all of our responsibility and it's about what we do next that's important.
And it's very easy to fail.
And it's what's kept you alive.
And learn to perceive the mysteries of the Force as the Zeffo once did.
And let me be clear: I don't want any monster plants trying to eat me in my sleep!
And may the Force be with you.
And most importantly...
And my misplaced loyalty has allowed you to lead the Nightbrothers astray.
And now he dies!
And now that I have what I need, you're of no use to me.
And now that she knows who you are...
And now we gotta hold him back...
And now we've got a Jedi on our doorstep who thinks he can destroy everything we've worked for!
And now?
And our reinforcements?
And promised me revenge.
And since you're not a Jedi anymore, that's why you need me.
And something in me gave.
And summon your weapon.
And take control of Kashyyyk and the Wookiees all at once. I can see why Saw's here.
And that is... their choice, or yours?
And that planet was the trashiest. I can't believe anyone would 
And that's that.
And the Empire?
And the clone commander. He didn't know they'd turned.
And the great sacrifice they've made.
And the pay was better back during the Republic too.
And then sabotage their sensors so the Mantis can extract us.
And then when they asked what that was...
And there never will be on my watch.
And they'll die without our help.
And they... tortured me.
And this is my captain, Greez Dritus. 
And we couldn't have gotten this far without you.
And we trust you.
And we will control it. 
And we will. We all have to support each other. That's the only way to succeed.
And we won't.
And we'll make good use of it. Still, I'd like to see their records.
And what about when you lose? 
And what did YOU think?
And what she does next is the cost of all of my mistakes.
And when I do find out what's going on, you will all hear about it!
And when I saw her eyes...
And when Malicos came?
And where he went.
And who are you?
And why'd you help me?
And yet nothing received greater honor here than the Force itself, the Life Wind, as they called it.
And yet the fire... still burns.
And yet there is one gift that intrigues me, statuary of Zeffo holding circular objects much like spheres.
And you didn't join them.
And you get on and just start apologizing. Sorry, we didn't know. Sensor's down, my co-pilot's sick.
And you got me. We're in this together. 
And you know her so well, huh?
And you listened.
And you passed. Congratulations.
And you seek only to bring him into your family.
And you will help them, as you have helped me.
And you're not alone.
And you're still alive.
And you're very good at it. You're very strong, Greez. That's why I chose you.
And you?
And your Jedi.
And your friends...
And your sacrifice.
And... there we go!
And?
Angers you.
Animal casualty.
Annihilate him. 
Annihilate the pest.
Annoying adversary.
Anomaly detected.
Another Emperor.
Another Haxion Brood bounty hunter.
Another ally down.
Another bounty hunter...
Another creature destroyed!
Another easy kill.
Another enemy down. Infuriating...
Another falls to our might!
Another good kill.
Another hijacked cutter!
Another kill for me!
Another kill.
Another locked door for you. 
Another low-level target.
Another mark down. 
Another meaningless entity neutralized.
Another one down...
Another one falls!
Another one of those things.
Another one?
Another pest dead!
Another planet, another dangerous risk.
Another stim module here.
Another stim module. Want this, BD?
Another stim!
Another target eliminated. 
Another traitor dead!
Another weakling culled. 
Another!
Anxious, Jedi?
Any Jedi gets near me and I'll blast them!
Any bets on what horrible thing'll happen this time? More dead things? Giant spiders? Killer plants?
Any breach of this fortress is a useless gesture.
Any chance Cordova left a more direct map lying around here?
Any day now!
Any idea what that flying creature is?
Any ideas? Gotta get across this gap somehow.
Any new activity?
Any sign of Trilla?
Any sign of the enemy?
Any sign of the tomb?
Any weak points at all?
Any word on the refinement process?
Anybody else?
Anybody here?
Anyone else hear that weird noise earlier? 
Anyone see my good spoon? Ugh...
Anyone there?
Anyone there? 
Anyone who isn't humanoid enough is a target for them.
Anything could happen here, but I'm ready.
Anything less is insubordination. That understood, soldier?
Anything useful?
Anytime. 
Anyway, that's a story for another time.
Anyways, all that is in the past. I'm sure it won't be a problem.
Appears so... I don't blame him. Dathomir is not kind to outsiders.
Appreciate it, BD. 
Appreciate it.
Apprentice. Mark well and listen:
Approach and identify yourself. 
Approach this fight. 
Approach with caution!
Are all Jedi so weak?
Are all the flametroopers down?
Are in the past.
Are the Inquisitors coming?
Are the partisan attacks still happening?
Are they running some kind of drill?
Are those stims?
Are we clear?
Are we even authorized to check this out?
Are we fighting or what?
Are we good enough to win?
Are we out of heavy artillery? 
Are we ready to leave?
Are we really leaving Mari and the others?
Are we too much?
Are you above us?
Are you afraid?
Are you aiming?
Are you alright?
Are you and Greez safe?
Are you both still mad at me? The Greez guy? 
Are you done?
Are you doubting the Empire's intelligence? 
Are you down there?
Are you even trying?
Are you feeling it now?
Are you going to fight this time?
Are you gonna go down there?
Are you gonna help me with this?
Are you looking for cover?
Are you okay BD?
Are you okay?
Are you okay?!?
Are you paying attention, rookie?
Are you ready for what comes next?
Are you ready to pilot this thing? 
Are you ready, Cal?
Are you ready, Jedi!?
Are you ready. Jedi?
Are you really a Jedi?
Are you running away?
Are you scared, Greez?
Are you scared, Padawan?
Are you scared?
Are you seeing this?
Are you shaking, Jedi?
Are you so feeble?
Are you supposed to be able to do that?
Are you sure it's dead?
Are you sure it's something you should find?
Are you sure we can?
Are you sure you want to do this?
Are you sure?
Are you talking about Master Yoda? Yes, he is very legendary.
Are you trying?
Are you with us?
Are... are you sure he's dead?
Aren't you enjoying this?
Aren't you having fun?
Aren't you worried we'll have to fight an insurgent?
Argh!
Argh! All flame support down!
Argh! Filthy traitor.
Argh! That was our last gunner!
Argh, enough!
Arms personnel, KIA.
Artillery is down.
Artillery is down. 
Artillery taken down.
Artillery trooper down!
As I always have.
As expected.
As far as I'm concerned, none of them have names or identities, and when I'm through, they won't have lives. 
As long as it's a challenge.
As long as the Emperor keeps the right people happy it'll never stop.
As long as they keep their distance.
As long as they're gone. That's what matters.
As long as we get back up we're still in this fight.
As long as we pay attention and don't get too close we'll be fine.
As long as were careful and pay attention the scazz won't get us.
As long as you keep your habits in check.
As they should have been. They threatened the power of the Empire and failed. You did your part, stormtrooper.
As we were.
As weak as the rest of your order.
As well as your own.
As you know, many Jedi have come to Ilum to find their kyber crystal.
As you were.
As you wish.
Assail the intruder!
Assailant defending incoming aggression.
Assailant exiting fight.
Assailant, up there!
Assault him!
Assault ineffective.
Assist me!
Assuming we'll live to have one.
At ease, I'll see what it is.
At first I believed them votives to the Life Wind,
At first, I knew little. But I learned that I do not need a master to know its secrets. Power flows freely through Dathomir -- the air, the roots, the waters and even my blood. 
At last, a Jedi.
At last.
At least at that time, they hadn't flagged us yet.
At least in those fights, you had a chance. 
At least it was 'til the Empire took over. It's changed ever since the wars.
At least that's what I thought.
At least try to fight!
At least we have the high ground.
At least we were able to take him down. 
At least we're still alive.
At least you wouldn't die a coward. 
At the clones? Yeah, I was angry. I still can't make sense of what happened.

Aye, aye.

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-beeeeep!

B-b-b-b-eeeeep.
BD does it again. 
BD!
BD! Don't come any closer!
BD! Help please!
BD! Here!
BD! Stim here!
BD's the only reliable one. He let Cordova wipe his memories so he could stay behind and guide us.
BD, I need help!
BD, I think this is your strength.
BD, can you slice it? 
BD, charge this. 
BD, could use your help here. 
BD, do what you do. 
BD, door. 
BD, jolt? 
BD, need an overcharge here. 
BD, overcharge. 
BD, stay back!
BD, stim!
BD, think you can charge this?
BD, think you can slice this?
BD, this could use some power. 
BD, toss me a stim.
BD, we got to get through this way. 
BD, what is that thing?!
BD, you like this ship?
BD-1 is part of the crew, but I've come across many who think less of droids. Even more since the Empire.
BD-1 thinks so.
BD-1 will aid you on your journey. He will be your guide.
BD-1!
BD-1! Over here!
BD-1! Stim!
BD-1's a helpful droid.
BD-1, This may be the last you see of me. I can sense the doom of the Jedi Order is upon us.
BD-1, any ideas?
BD-1, is that you?
BD-1, keep an eye on Cal for us.
BD-1.
BD-1?
BD. Listen, we've come a long way, but if you get oil or whatever on my plants...
BD...
BD?
BD? Got something to help me?
BEEEEEEP!
BEEP!
BEEP! Boo bee boop beep?!?
BOOP!
BWEEEEE!
Back at the scrapyard, I dreamed about fighting the Empire. 
Back off!
Back off.
Back off. 
Back off. If you attack me again, I'll strike you down.
Back still hurting?
Back to Zeffo, huh?
Back to Zeffo. 
Back to patrol. 
Back to posts!
Back up. I've got this.
Back when I was a Seeker, I traveled from planet to planet in the Galaxy searching for Jedi.
Back!
Back, Jedi!
Back, Jedi! 
Back, Jedi. 
Back, scum!
Back, traitor!
Bad choice. 
Bad idea.
Bad plan. You never thought of doing that, did you?
Bad technique. 
Badly damaged. We're at 70% integrity and falling.
Barely a scratch.
Barely any brains in these things. 
Barely even scraped me. 
Barely made it past those scazz.
Barely made it...
Barely noticed.
Barely worth a fight. 
Barely. I'm lucky I don't have a fear of heights. 
Barrage redirected.
Based on this imagery, I believe this object allows a Force wielder to perceive the mysteries of the Vault.
Bash him!
Bashing opponent.
Bashing provided.
Basic computer protocol at the Jedi Academy was searching the galaxy for Force-sensitives.

Be careful fighting slyyyg, rookie. They're faster than you think. 
Be careful here, Cal.
Be careful here, Cal. It's a dark place. 
Be careful on Bogano. It may be remote, but that doesn't mean it isn't dangerous. 
Be careful!
Be careful! He's dangerous. 
Be careful! That was our last gunner!
Be careful.
Be cautious. I sense great danger.
Be faster. 
Be for nothing.
Be mindful of his tricks. 
Be mindful of your emotions, young one.
Be more careful.
Be observant when navigating around Zeffo as skungus can grow on many surfaces throughout the planet.
Be on your guard. 
Be quicker!
Be ready for a fight.
Be ready to mobilize on my command.
Be ready.
Be ready. We don't know what this outsider can do.
Be right back. 
Be right there.
Be safe, Mirienna. 
Be wary of their mischief, brother.
Be wary!
Be wary, Padawan, you do not choose your crystal, it chooses you.
Be wary.

Because I had all this rage.
Because I know what it means to live without it. 
Because it was cooked with tender, loving care and... my good spoon!
Because of the Empire? That's tough...
Because she's a liar.
Because you're pretty great.

Before I open it, there is something you should know. We may encounter risen Nightsisters.
Before Master Tapal died.
Before joining you? Only Dathomir.
Before the Empire, I fought for sport. Undefeated.
Before the Empire?
Before the Purge.
Before they disappeared, the Zeffo journeyed to the planet Kashyyyk.
Before this assignment, I'd never heard of Purge Troopers. What does it take to be one?
Before you came along, all I cared about was a tight hand on a stiff heater.
Before you two, all I cared about was myself.
Before you, this quest was all on my shoulders. Sure, I had Greez, but
Begin vertical search routine. 
Beginning total memory encryption.
Being an Inquisitor taught me no set-back is too great.
Being parried.
Being up there won't help.
Below us, Brothers. 
Below us.
Below!
Below! The Jedi is below!
Below.
Below. 
Beneath us.
Beoooop!
Beooop!

Besides Jedi?
Besides, it all worked out in the end, didn't it? 
Besides, uh... Kid kind of looks up to me.
Best in the galaxy.
Bestial deceased.
Bet that hurt!
Better be more careful...
Better be quick.
Better be something good...
Better call this in.
Better catch up!
Better check it out. 
Better double back and tell the squad.
Better find seeds for Greez.
Better get a closer look.
Better get a move on, Cal.
Better get a move on, Cal. Jaro isn't a patient one.
Better get on this.
Better go look. 
Better go watch the perimeter or somethin', kid. This place is still dangerous.
Better hope those bars hold...
Better hurry. Otherwise you'll never get promoted. 
Better keep your skills up, Greezy.
Better look into that. 
Better look into this. 
Better stay over there!
Better than I thought.
Better than before.
Better than hiding on a scrapyard for years.
Better to face death than to have death face you.
Better watch yourselves. 
Better watch!
Better you than me, kid. Everyone talkin' about you. Knowing who you are. Admiring you. Loving you. Hating you.
Better, Padawan. Join me.
Better.
Between you and Trilla. What you both went through.
Bew!
Beware his tricks!
Beware of projectiles.
Beware this one!
Beware! Dathomir's mysteries are many.
Beware, if a slyyyg is moving towards you it likely believes you are its lunch.
Beware, they spit their venom.
Bewoo...
Beyond Jedi understanding.
Big mistake to mess with us.
Big mistake.
Big thing over here. 
Bigger cut for me.
Blast 'em!

Blasted fire!
Blasted flames!
Blasted flying beast!
Blasted flying creature!
Blasted nydaks! Without the Sisters, they're growing too bold.
Blasted pest.
Blasted rats! I only walked away for a second.
Blasted scazz stole my blaster. I got punished by the commander.
Blasted slyyyg...
Blasted traitor!
Blaster fire!
Blasters are down, can you fix them?
Blasters are ineffective. 
Blasters live. 
Blasters seem to not work. 
Bleed for me!
Bleed for me, Jedi. 
Bleed for the Brood. 
Bleed him dry!
Bleed, traitor!
Bleed, vermin!
Blinded by endless war.
Block all you want - I only need a few hits. 
Block not anticipated.

Bogano feels more simplistic, and yet... I can't figure it out.
Bogano here we come. 
Bogano is special. There's a reason the Zeffo built their Vault here.
Bogano is still a bit dangerous. I know you've dealt with worse, but be careful.
Bogano it is. 
Bogie, over there.

Building our lightsabers brings us closer to ourselves, the Force, and each other.
Built by a vanished civilization known as the Zeffo.
Bullseye. 
Burn.
Burrr ooop!
Bust his head!
But Cal, there's still a chance we can save the others on the holocron.
But Cordova did come here. That I'm sure of.
But I conquered it.
But I do not. I want to understand this galaxy, and those who fight for it.
But I don't think this is the right time for it.
But I have orders to keep watch.
But I hit a limit. To him, there was no limit.
But I knew your Master.
But I know this: they were pawns, just like we were.
But I promise you this...
But I tend to focus on the little victories. Like for one thing: we all have full stomachs.
But I think the power still needs to be on.
But I would've said the same about Trilla hijacking your comm. Greez and I will search the Mantis.
But I'm looking for a Jedi Padawan.
But I'm more a runner, keep your distance kinda guy.
But I'm still getting a lot of interference on the comms.
But I'm sure he's more than that.
But Kashyyyk... I thought the blockade was secure.
But a key...
But also know that no matter what happens, good or bad, there will always be another challenge to overcome.
But he always had time for a round of holochess.
But he wouldn't send us here for his amusement. Keep an open mind.
But how else am I supposed to get data on them?
But how?!
But if there's already one here, why does Cere need me?
But in the end I came apart.
But it requires someone strong in the Force to pass its test.
But it's easy for successful leaders to grow accustomed to fame and glory.
But it's never over, Malicos.
But look, that's not the point. The point is I broke into one of the most secure buildings in the Republic!
But master, this is easy!
But most of it's underwater, you'll need this breather.
But most of it's underwater. There's an extra breather in that chest, take it with you.
But most of it's underwater. You'll need to find a breather.
But my murdered sisters...
But myself and the others will find a new way to serve the cause.
But not anymore.
But not wise.
But nothing can bring back my people.
But she's paying the bills, so can't complain, really. 
But standing up to that bog rat? Pretty brave.
But that is the test.
But that's not all...
But that's why we can't give up.
But the Empire's interest in the Zeffo tomb does have me concerned.
But then I learned about the holocron.
But then this...
But they almost broke me.
But they haven't breached the next tomb. They just woke up a bunch of guardians.
But things are bad down there.
But this is about something bigger...
But we all know the truth.
But we have a common enemy.
But we're still alive. For now, that's enough to keep our future.
But what If I get assigned to garbage duty?!
But what if they come up under my feet?
But when it's behind a comfortably thick wall of Umbaran glass? That's perfection.
But who destroyed images of it and why?
But who would destroy images of it and why?
But wrong. Corrupted.
But yeah, they're fine. Long as I don't forget to cut 'em.
But you always come back?
But you control them, so nothing to worry about?
But you didn't attack them?
But you didn't give in to it.
But you escaped.
But you know, you could pay me back with some seeds.
But you remain connected through the Force.
But you still want to rebuild the Order?
But you went through the same thing she did.
But you'll need more than a weapon to cross the many perils of Dathomir.
But you're both willing to sacrifice everything; to keep going even when it seems impossible.
But your memory will be completely lost.
But yours has cost you the lives of all the Force-sensitive children on that list.
But,
But, they evolved at an alarming rate due to their number of offspring! We're talking millions per generation!
But, this place...
But, yes, that Nightsister. Oh.
But... the insurgents...
But... they caught me.
But... we didn't last long.
But... what if it sneaks up on us?
Bwa-ahahahah!
Bwe-we-we-we-we. Woo!
Bwee
Bwee dee doo!
Bwee dee?
Bwee do doo!
Bwee do dooo!
Bwee doo!

By the power that lurks within.
By the right of the Council, by the will of the Force. Cal Kestis.
By the skin of our teeth. It'll be harder without you.
By the skin of our teeth. It'll be harder without your help.
Bye!
Bzzt bap-beeeep! 
Bzzt be-ba-bee-beep!
Bzzt be-ba-beeep!
Bzzt d-d-doot-doot!
Bzzt trill!
C'mon buddy.
C'mon up!
C'mon!
C'mon, hit me!
C'mon, let's go.
C'mon. It isn't that smart.
C'mon. We're going to find Tarfful.
C-chase him!
C-cover me!
Cal Kestis!
Cal Kestis, you've made it.
Cal Kestis.
Cal befriended the Shyyyo bird. He seems to have a knack for making unusual allies.
Cal this is... uh... I didn't get his name. But we're all busy, so let's just keep doing what we're doing.
Cal told me you were once a Jedi. What made you quit?
Cal!
Cal! I can't climb up!
Cal! Use the manual override lever below!
Cal, Cal!
Cal, I need you to hear this. 
Cal, I take responsibility for him. You have nothing to worry about.
Cal, I'm Mari Kosan and this is Commander Choyyssyk. 
Cal, I'm near your position but sealed behind a blast door.
Cal, I'm sorry. I am meditating right now.
Cal, a word?
Cal, as long as you're alive you will always have a choice.
Cal, be careful here.
Cal, buddy... Have you been outside? Do you know where we are?
Cal, can you hear me?
Cal, care to join me?
Cal, careful here.
Cal, do you have a moment?
Cal, do you have a second?
Cal, do you read me? Cere gave me your comm frequency.
Cal, do you read me? Cere just sent me your comm frequency.
Cal, even the strongest of Jedi...
Cal, find a way to slice into their system.
Cal, get back up! Get back up!
Cal, good to see you back in one piece. Mari Kosan contacted us. We know you couldn't find Tarfful.
Cal, got a second?
Cal, have you found the tomb?
Cal, hurry!
Cal, it's time I told you everything that happened to me when I escaped the Empire.
Cal, life's not a game.
Cal, look for a control room. I've got a plan.
Cal, look out!
Cal, over here!
Cal, pay attention. I ain't ready to dig into that episode yet.
Cal, remember this is an active Imperial site. We should move quickly and carefully.
Cal, the Empire's pinpointed your location.
Cal, this sap is very interesting.
Cal, watch out!
Cal, we ain't all Jedi. Most of us gotta scrape by and occasionally, make some bets we wish we hadn't.
Cal, we found Tarfful and he is willing to meet you.
Cal, we've got a walker firing on us and our weapons are down!
Cal, when I was captured by the Empire...
Cal, you read me?
Cal, you there?
Cal, you were only a child.
Cal, your instincts are good but that's not within your control.
Cal.
Cal. Cal.
Cal. Did you hear that? I think Cere here is finally coming around to my cooking. 
Cal. Kestis.
Cal...
Cal... just trying to get my mind off of this place. 
Calculations unsupported.
Call it off. 
Callin' it quits? 
Calm down, rookie. Just point your blaster at them and shoot.
Calm yourself, stormtrooper. This is an extermination. Nothing more.
Can ANYTHING stop this Jedi?!
Can I get a stim, BD?
Can I get a stim, buddy?
Can I get some aid?
Can I get some help?
Can I have a moment with my ship? 
Can anyone hit him?
Can someone get him!
Can someone stop him?
Can we actually win this?
Can we cut the power to these panels?
Can we get through?
Can we really beat him? 
Can we talk?
Can we win without gunners?
Can you afford to take that chance?
Can you believe these things are still growing? They grow up so fast.
Can you feel that? Death is calling you.
Can you get the weapons working?
Can you get to him?
Can you help me with this pipe?
Can you hit him with something?
Can you hit him?
Can you overcharge this for me? 
Can you patch me up?
Can you reverse what she's done?
Can you see that?
Can you shut that guy up?
Can you slice this open?
Can you slice this?
Can you survive?
Can you tell that bucket of bolts to keep his opinion to himself.
Can you undo the spell?
Can't argue with that.
Can't argue with that. Now let's keep that up.
Can't avoid death forever. 
Can't be more than a few years old.
Can't believe I'm stuck looking for a Jedi.
Can't believe that actually worked.
Can't block forever. 
Can't block this. 
Can't catch me. 
Can't catch me?
Can't dodge forever. 
Can't dodge them all. 
Can't drop me. 
Can't escape me!
Can't escape me. 
Can't escape the Brood. 
Can't finish the job?
Can't get away from this. 
Can't get me. 
Can't get through.
Can't get through. 
Can't go this way.
Can't handle it?
Can't handle the pain, Jedi?
Can't hit me?
Can't jump that high.
Can't move!
Can't move. 
Can't reach?
Can't run forever!
Can't run forever. 
Can't run from me this time.
Can't see him.
Can't spent money if you're dead.
Can't stand on your own?
Can't stop all of 'em. 
Can't stop all of us. 
Can't stop everything.
Can't stop me. 
Can't stop them all. 
Can't stop this!
Can't stop this. 
Can't take a few hits?
Can't take a hit, huh?
Can't take a hit?
Can't take a hit? 
Can't take a little pain?
Can't take it, Jedi?
Can't take it?
Can't take it? 
Can't take much more...
Can't take the pain?
Can't take the pain? 
Can't take the pressure?
Can't topple me. 
Can't track him! 
Can't trust machines to do a stormtrooper's job. 
Can't use this lift from here.
Can't use this lift yet.
Can't wait to bring you in.
Can't wait to report this.
Can't wait to see these in the terrarium.
Can't wait to tell my commanders. 
Can't wait to watch these grow.
Can't wait.
Can't win a fair fight?
Can't win em all.
Can't win fairly?
Can't win, can you?
Can't you move the Mantis?
Can't you see I'm reading here?
Can't... move.
Can't... move. 
Candles? Good call,  BD.
Cantinas?
Captain!
Captain! Prepare for takeoff.
Captain, I am slightly troubled by your enthusiasm for something so... barbaric.
Captain, I think we've found a way in.
Captain, get us near those walkers.
Captain, prepare for takeoff!
Captain.
Capture the Younglings... kill the rest.
Careful over there! That doesn't look safe.
Careful with that thing. 
Careful!
Careful! He's up there!
Careful, Brothers. 
Careful, Jedi are quick and can easily trick you.
Careful, Prauf!
Careful, buddy. We still don't know how this thing works.
Careful, he's got a laser sword.
Careful, stabilizer's out.
Careful, you're making me excited.
Careful.
Careful. 
Careful. We're missing ranged support.
Catch him!
Catch me now!
Catch this!
Catch your breath.
Catch!
Catch, Jedi. 
Catch. 
Caught me!
Caught that one, huh?
Caught you!
Caught you, Jedi. 
Caught you. 
Caution!
Caution, Brothers. Caution. 
Caution, threat mobile.
Cease deflecting attacks.
Cease operation.
Cease that.
Cease this!
Cere called them Force wielders, but I've never seen it used this way.
Cere has been through much. I find her strength... fascinating. 
Cere hired me for a job and a Lateron never quits. 
Cere will betray you. It's only a matter of time.
Cere! Cere, tell Greez to get the Mantis running!
Cere! We've got company. Tell Greez to close the Mantis!
Cere, Cere!
Cere, Greez, this is Merrin.
Cere, I just took down a trooper wearing black and red armor. The same type from Bracca.
Cere, I... thanks for helping me. Means a lot.
Cere, can you feel the Force at all?
Cere, is that you?
Cere, there's a transport ship leaving the Empire's base.
Cere, we need to get out of here. They've taken over Ilum.
Cere, we've got a problem: there are probe droids in the caverns.
Cere, why didn't you tell me?
Cere.
Cere. I remember the wonder of these caves - how I couldn't wait to complete my training and become a Jedi Knight. That's all gone now.
Cere. It looks like the Empire is mining kyber crystals.
Cere...
Cere... well, she used to be a Jedi. It's a long story.
Cere?
Cere? I've cleared out this area but the Empire's sealed me in. Any ideas?
Cere? She... well, she used to be a Jedi.
Cere?! Wait, how do you know about her?
Certify.
Challenge me!
Challenge me, Jedi!
Challenge me. 
Change position.
Changed my perspective.
Charge forward!
Charge this thing?
Charge!
Charged and ready!
Charged up!
Charger here.
Charging at target. 
Charging fauna approaching.
Charging fauna inbound.
Charging him. 
Charging my weapon!
Charging the target. 
Charging to the enemy's position.
Charging.
Charging. 
Chase him down!
Chase the traitor!
Chasing the Jedi!
Chasing the insurgent. 
Chasing you is part of the fun.
Check it out!
Check our perimeter!
Check out that mural.
Check that noise.
Check the sensors for any sign of a breach.
Check this out.
Check.
Checking our perimeter.
Checking out the disturbance.
Checking out the disturbance. 
Checking the perimeter.
Cheers

Choyyssyk and Mari drew a map to your rendezvous point with Tarfful.
Choyyssyk says he'll do whatever he can to find Tarfful and vouch for you.
Choyyssyk will help you find Tarfful, but they're always on the move. Could take some time. 
Chump.
Clamp secured!
Cleaned up another one.
Clearly you lack the power, little witch.
Clearly.
Clever.
Climb all you like, craven.
Clipped me. 
Clocked him!
Clone Troops turned against us, my Padawan and I took several Younglings and went into hiding.

Cordova believed it was important to study them all. You can never have enough tools in your belt. 
Cordova believed the key to the Vault is on Dathomir.
Cordova built danger into this test to protect it.
Cordova encouraged me to wander and explore, and always question my surroundings.
Cordova found wisdom at the top of the Origin Tree. You should seek answers there.
Cordova had a Wookiee friend named Tarfful. Maybe we can find him?
Cordova had supplies hidden all over Bogano. Could be worth a trip back to explore.
Cordova must have really liked droids, if he decided to leave such important information with BD-1.
Cordova must have said something about this place to you. Something to explain why he came here.
Cordova must've really loved these little guys.
Cordova put the holocron inside. That's what's important. I have to get it.
Cordova spent his life studying the history of the galaxy in many different places;
Cordova took some dangerous risks to study these ancient cultures.
Cordova trusted that I would come looking for him, but... I knew I wasn't the one he needed.
Cordova was a loner. That little droid and I are probably the only ones that know about Bogano.
Cordova was fascinated by the different ways many ancient societies perceived the Force. Some are still around. 
Cordova was here. He felt alone, missing his Padawan...
Cordova's repair kit. He hoped someone would pick up his trail... but left BD-1 to guide them.
Cordova.
Core conditions are optimal for crystal formation.
Core programming modified.
Correct, the project's operational again.
Correction. Everything was quiet.
Could be anything. A bird... well, I guess not a bird, but y-you know what I mean. 
Could be good for us...
Could be underneath us.
Could be. Or not. Just be ready. 
Could go either way.
Could they be looking for the tombs?
Could this be it?
Could us a little help, BD.
Could use some help, buddy.
Could you, for once, just listen to me?
Couldn't get away. 
Couldn't handle the fight?
Couldn't have done it without you, buddy.
Couldn't have done it without you.
Couldn't hurt, I guess.
Couldn't pay me enough to salvage live munitions.
Couldn't resist, could you?
Couple bumps ain't gonna kill ya, kid.
Course it's under control, it's just a little tricky.
Course you do.
Cover her!
Cover him!
Cover me while I do this!
Cover me!
Cover me! 
Cover me. I need a second.

Cut myself off from the Force.
D'you hear that?

D-down there!
Damage sustained.
Damage taken. 
Damaging Jedi.
Dangerous stuff. Thanks! 
Dangerous to crush the crawlers.
Dangerous, aren't you?
Dark shadow came.
Dark times.
Dark.
Dathomir belongs to the brothers.
Dathomir has unmade you.
Dathomir is a deadly place. We should be careful.
Dathomir is forbidden to you.
Dathomir is ours and they'll all soon know that.
Dathomir is ours to rule.
Dathomir is ours. He will not survive.
Dathomir is threatened by this outsider.
Dathomir is unforgiving. Return only when you're ready to face its perils in full. 
Dathomir or Zeffo? It's your choice.
Dathomir thirsts for your blood!
Dathomir will be your grave.
Dathomir, huh?
Dathomir. Who wants to go there?
Dathomir? Really? Okay. 
Dead Nightbrothers? We need to get out of here.
Dead crawler leaked poison on me.
Dead on!

Defeat him.
Defend, Jedi!
Defenses breached.
Definitely not.
Definitely still Imperial activity around Ilum.
Definitely worth the climb.
Deflected. 
Deflecting at range.

Departure is surrender.
Deploying entirely ranged attacks. Stand ready.
Descended upon us...
Desolate place.
Desperation deformed him. There are many experiences that can warp or break a person.
Despite my persistence, despite my research, they do not take this threat seriously.
Despite my reservations, I cannot chase the Bogano Vault from my mind.
Despite our wisdom and technological achievement, we face extinction.
Despite the damage, I recommend we see this through. Together.
Destroy him!
Destroy him. 
Destroy it!
Destroy it.
Destroy that creature.
Destroy that thing.
Destroy the creature.
Destroy the enemy. 
Destroy the intruder. 
Destroy the pest now!
Determined that the Jedi were making a mistake and what he was doing here was more important.
Detractor emerging weakened.
Did I feed 'em? Yes. No? Yes.
Did I kill it?
Did I lose him?
Did any of it matter?
Did anyone hear that?
Did he go above?
Did he go down there?
Did it block out the sky?
Did she survive?
Did that not work as planned?
Did things not go as planned?
Did we just chase away a Jedi?
Did we just open the way for the Empire?
Did we scare you?
Did you believe him?
Did you critique them too?
Did you ever find it?
Did you find something, BD-1?
Did you hear Gorgara cry last night?
Did you hear something?
Did you hear something? Watch for flanking.
Did you hear something? We should split up.
Did you hear that over the comm?
Did you hear that too?
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that? I think they're coming. We're done.
Did you hear the Jedi blew up a Refinery on Kashyyyk?
Did you hear the Jedi raised some kinda tomb on Zeffo?
Did you hear? KY-1661 was permanently reassigned to garbage duty. 
Did you hope to hit me!
Did you just look at me?
Did you just slice that?
Did you know the Ninth Sister before the purge?
Did you know the wyyyschokk is the largest terrestrial arachnid species on the planet?
Did you lose him?
Did you raise the ones before too?
Did you run a diagnostic?

Did you see the report?

Did you see where he went?
Did you take notes on our patrol?
Did you think you'd escape?
Didn't even break the skin.
Didn't expect that.
Didn't expect this?
Didn't get a medal, but...I probably deserved one.
Didn't get hit once!
Didn't see that coming!
Didn't think you had it in you.
Didn't you just arrive off a transport?
Didn't you?

Disengage your powers!
Disgraceful Padawan.
Disgusting creature!
Disgusting creature.
Dismantle this traitor.
Disrupt his focus!
Dissension eminent.
Distraction. They were so confused they let us go.
Do I ever have any luck? Of course not.
Do I know you?
Do I like Cere and Greez? They're fine... I guess.
Do I? No, no, I've got wasaka berry.
Do copy. 
Do it!
Do it, BD-1!
Do not die yet, Jedi.

Do not test my patience.
Do not try to escape. 
Do not underestimate her power.
Do something. 
Do the Jedi have such a ritual?
Do we have eyes on the Jedi?
Do we know anything about it?
Do we need his body to collect?
Do what you gotta do, buddy. 
Do what you gotta do. But if you find my datapad, let me know.
Do you also hear that?
Do you fear death, Jedi? 
Do you fear death?
Do you feel alive, Jedi?
Do you feel it?
Do you have a gundark's blood candle?
Do you have eyes on him?
Do you know anything about the Nightsisters of Dathomir?
Do you know how much those cost?!
Do you know something I don't?
Do you know what this means, my friend?
Do you like music, Merrin?
Do you mind, BD?
Do you mind? I'm taking me time. 
Do you mind? We're having a moment.
Do you need help?
Do you remember the first time you held a holocron? I do, vividly.
Do you see anyone else? Is that it?
Do you see him up there?
Do you see him?
Do you see that BD-1?
Do you see that BD?
Do you see? Intruder! Above!
Do you think any of these insurgents will be dangerous?
Do you think he'll come back?
Do you think he's still alive?
Do you think it ever stops being painful?
Do you think someone's around here?
Do you think someone's sneaking around?
Do you think that's an intruder?
Do you think that's why the Zeffo chose this planet?
Do you think the Empire will find us?
Do you think the Empire would've come after Kashyyyk so hard if we hadn't intervened?
Do you think the Inquisitors will find us here?
Do you think there could be survivors?
Do you think we'll be stationed on this backwater forever?
Do you think we'll run into insurgents soon? Uh, sir?
Do you understand?
Do you use that spoon for conjuring?
Do you wanna hold the line with one of those charging at you?
Do you want more?
Do you want to be next?
Do you? Good. Keep failing, keep getting back up.
Do your magic, BD. 
Do your thing, buddy. 
Dodge all you want. I'll keep trying.
Dodge detected.
Dodge it. 
Dodge this!
Dodge this. 
Dodging a little fast. 
Dodging again?
Dodging won't save you!
Dodging. 
Does anyone have eyes on him? Anyone?
Does it hurt?
Does not look good.
Does that hurt, scum?
Does that mean?
Does this look fixed to you?
Does your new master not train you?
Doesn't matter what you steal. You'll never understand it.
Doesn't matter. I'll still win. 
Doesn't mean it's safe. Be careful, Cal.
Doesn't seem credible.
Doesn't surprise me. Rations at this posting are terrible.
Dogma blinded us to the path of balance and gradually we allowed our pride to corrupt us.
Doing alright, BD?
Doing alright? I see you're in your favorite place.
Doing okay back there, BD-1?
Doing okay, BD-1?
Don't anger me.
Don't anticipate surrender, expect war.
Don't be a fool. Keep focus.
Don't be caught off guard!
Don't be discouraged, Cal. We're here to change that.
Don't be his next target!
Don't be next!
Don't be next.
Don't be scared. We have a deal. You promised to teach me your Magicks.
Don't be so serious.
Don't become hopeful.

Don't get back up. Don't get back up. 
Don't get bit by the wyyyschokk.
Don't get careless.
Don't get careless.

Don't get his hopes up with second-hand gossip.
Don't get hit next time.
Don't get hit.
Don't get hit. 
Don't get hit. Phillak here.
Don't get near the water, buddy. Even you can't carry that much current.
Don't get sloppy.
Don't give him an opening!
Don't give in to him. 
Don't give up yet.
Don't give up!
Don't give up, Brothers. 
Don't go. We need to stick together.
Don't have to tell me twice.
Don't hide underneath me.
Don't impede my attack.
Don't interfere. 
Don't just stand there! Do something!
Don't just watch this happen again!
Don't keep wasting my time.

Don't let him recover!
Don't let him recover.
Don't let him rest.
Don't let him run!
Don't let him take another!
Don't let him use stims.
Don't let it be over.
Don't let it end yet!
Don't let it get you!
Don't let it hit you!
Don't let that be you.
Don't let the Jedi out of your sight.
Don't let up!
Don't let up.
Don't let up. 
Don't let yourself get discouraged.
Don't like our chances here.
Don't listen to them. I still love you.
Don't look so nervous. 
Don't lose him!
Don't lose him.
Don't lose him. 
Don't lose hope.
Don't lose sight of him.
Don't lose sight of him. 
Don't lose sight!
Don't lose track of him!
Don't lose track of him. 
Don't make Jedi like they used to.
Don't make me chase you!
Don't mention it.
Don't move.
Don't move. 
Don't panic! Keep steady. 
Don't panic. Focus. 
Don't remember? I've never known a forgetful droid.
Don't run.
Don't say that!

Don't suppose you know the way outta here?
Don't tell me my business.
Don't test me.
Don't they know what we're dealing with?
Don't think I can call the lift from here.
Don't think we can slice that.
Don't toy with me, Jedi.
Don't toy with us.
Don't trip me.
Don't trip up. 
Don't trip!
Don't trip.
Don't try it, Jedi. 
Don't try nuthin' too crazy, Cal!
Don't try to escape me!
Don't try to run.
Don't underestimate him, we'd be lucky if either of us get out alive.
Don't underestimate the tactics of these fighters. Gerrera's ruthless.
Don't wanna fight?
Don't want a real fight?
Don't want to spook it.
Don't waste my time. 
Don't waste time.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about me just... get it and get out.
Don't worry about me. We have a job to do.
Don't worry, I'll find my own way out.
Don't worry, I've got the door.
Don't worry, we're nearly done here.
Don't worry. I'll save something for you to do.
Don't you have a lightsaber to get or somethin'? Hurry up, we've got a galaxy to save.
Don't you have stuff to do? The faster you do your thing, the faster this is all over for me.
Don't you run!
Don't you think, kid? The Mantis and Greez. Every time, perfect landing. 
Don't you trust the force?
Don't you understand?
Don't!
Don't... let him run!
Done and done.
Done with that.
Done!
Doo do?
Doo woooo!

Door opened up.
Door's jammed. Let me try something else.
Door's open, but there's electricity running through the water.
Door, meet BD.
Doot doo!
Douse the flames!
Down here.
Down here? Doubt it.
Down there!
Down there! Look!
Down there.

Droid, keep an eye on the kid for us.
Droids destroyed.
Droids just freak me out.
Droids lost.
Drop 'em!
Drop him before he gets close!
Drop me now!
Drop me now. 
Drop me!

Dropping flashbang. 
Dropping him.
Dropping target. 
Duck!
Dull tricks.
During my nap, I heard someone in my room but when I got up to see who it was - nothing. No one. 
During our travels to find you, Greez and I encountered many who are far from ignorant when it comes to the Empire.
During the Clone Wars the Nightsisters made a deal with a Sith Lord who betrayed their trust.
Dwoo boo do!
Dwoo!
Dwooo!

Each injustice spurs others to join our cause. If we stand together, we can win. 
Each path is different, young one. Be mindful of your anger.
Ears open.
Ears open. Something here. 
Easy credits over there. 
Easy does it, rookie. We got a long day of guard duty ahead.
Easy enough.
Easy for you to say. You're the best shot in the squad.
Easy money.
Easy now.
Easy pay. 
Easy payday.
Easy pickings.
Easy there.
Easy. I'm not your enemy.
Eat this!
Eccentric? Tell me about it.
Eh, I can't get a clear shot. They always run away.
Eh, I'll just shoot it and it won't reach me.
Eh, I've got this. 
Eh, don't worry about it. Friends - friends are overrated.
Eh, don't worry about me. I've been through worse. As long as my ship flies, I'll be fine.
Eh, more of an understanding. I've had my share of war, battles... who hasn't, really? 
Eh, stop being so scared. We can take it.
Eh, that's nothing. 
Eh, they deserved that. 
Eh, they were just in my way.
Eh, who needs 'em. 
Eh?
Either way, the Empire will find him. 
Either way, we'll get him.
Eliminate the creature.
Eliminate the insurgents.

Embrace your demise!
Emperor give me strength!
Empire is everywhere.
Empire must've left in a hurry...
Empire waiting for you on the other side, Cere.
Empire's gonna get a lot of good material out of it.

Escape to the transports!
Especially after we wiped out that feeble resistance.
Especially after what he pulled on Zeffo.
Especially the small one.
Especially those nydaks...
Evade the blaster bolts!
Evading the Jedi. 
Even I saw that coming.
Even I was drawn to the adventure of it all. 
Even after cutting yourself off from the Force.
Even easier than I thought.
Even me, believe it or not. One time, I hid out from a Hutt loanshark in a bale of Nerf fur.
Even when it means risking your lives?
Eventually you gotta move on and live your life. Find your destiny.
Ever been around so many Wookiees?
Ever piloted a ship before?
Ever seen a place like this before?
Ever since I picked this ship up, it's been my only home. 
Ever win on a bet?
Every Jedi comes here as a kid. Or, they did.
Every Jedi faces the dark side.
Every death, every dead end, creates a fighter who isn't afraid to lose. Enough of them and we'll take the day.
Every kill is for the Empire. 
Every last one of them.
Every master trains their Padawan in their own way.
Every time I open myself up, I see Master Tapal.
Every time we're here, I have my doubts we'll survive.
Everybody up. Identification ready.
Everyone!
Everyone, retreat! We'll cover you!
Everything okay, BD-1?
Everything okay?
Everything quiet at the moment.
Everything you need, you have. Lose yourself, and you lose completely.
Everywhere I've been stationed. This ain't why I enlisted.
Everywhere. It is within me. It surrounds me.
Exactly...
Excellent, Cal.
Excellent.
Excellent. 
Except for her.
Except the holocron is hidden deep inside the Vault and to get it we have to follow Cordova's path.
Except where they belong, over a fire.
Excited to get back and meet the others?
Excuse me, Cal. I am not used to such talkative company.
Excuse me, Cal. I'm trying to focus.
Excuse me, Cal. I'm working.
Excuse me, sir. Do you think I would be able to give your weapon a try?
Excuse me, sir. Do you think we were stationed here by mistake? There's nothing but vermin here. 
Execute Order 66.
Execute the intruder!
Exhaust yourself all you like.
Explains the jogan fruit smell. Pretty creepy though.
Exposing her true nature.

Face your death, Jedi!
Face your death, craven weakling!
Face your destruction!
Facing you...
Fadin', Jedi? 
Failure is not the end, my friend.
Failure to turn over this traitor will result in a charge of sedition. 
Failure's a part of the journey.
Failure.
Fall back to the prisons!
Fall back!
Fall!
Fall, traitor!
Familiar words, Malicos.
Fan out and search!
Fancy moves.

Feel safe behind that saber?
Feel that energy around you...
Feel the Empire's wrath!

Fight with me, Brothers. 
Fighting for what?
Fighting organism. 
Fighting that walker seems to have made you more confident.
Figured you'd know what to do. 
Filth!
Filthy nydaks are everywhere.
Filthy traitor!
Filthy vermin. Attack!
Final flametrooper down!
Final rocket trooper down. 
Finally a challenge!
Finally some action!
Finally something to do!
Finally!
Finally! 
Finally, a chance to kill a Jedi!
Finally, some action.
Finally, something to look into. 
Finally. A challenger. 
Finally. I'm ready to be gone from this dump.
Find a way to get the power back to the system.
Find a way to him! Now!
Find a way to him.
Find a way to slice into their system.
Find a weak point!
Find an Astrium. If any still exists.
Find an opening.
Find him!
Find it amusing?
Find me more opponents. 
Find something, buddy?
Find something?
Find your destiny.
Fine! Run!
Fine.
Finish him quick. 
Finish the fight.
Finish the job!
Finish this. 
Fire all weapons!

Fire! Kill him now!
Firing at target!
Firing on the enemy.
Firing!
Firing. 
First the Empire, now bounty hunters? You have a talent for making enemies. 
First the bugs, now it's insurgents and Jedi? We're all gonna die here.
First though, we have orders.
First we gotta figure out a way out of this place.

Focus on his guard!
Focus on the goal. Failure will not defeat you.
Focus on your timing.
Focus your fire!
Focus!
Focus, Jedi. 
Focus. Were you concentrating you would have anticipated this distraction.
Follow him closely. 
Follow it. Let the Force sharpen your instincts.
Follow me!
Follow me.
Follow them. And stay out of my way.
Foolish girl.
Foolish!
Foolish.
Footing unstable. 
For Kashyyyk!
For Onderon!
For a good cause though, right?
For generations the Wookiees made a pilgrimage to the top. The tree... guided them?
For my brother!
For now.
For some.
For such a peaceful culture to have any sort of fascination with a place so...
For the Brood. 
For the Emperor!
For the Empire!
For the Empire. 
For the cause!
For the cause.
For those untrained, it is very dangerous. A Nightsister must master her power without losing control.
For what purpose?
For what reason?
For what we need, yes. It's not easy. When I escaped from interrogation, I stole some code clearances.
For what?
For years you said the Jedi orchestrated the massacre that killed my Sisters.
For you, maybe. For me it's a waste of time. 
Force or a quest to save the galaxy, but my old crew back on Lateron, we all had differences about the Empire, about our home -
Foreign influence purged.
Forgive me. I must ally with Malicos.
Form up on him. 
Form up on me. 
Form up!
Formal inquiry inaugurated.
Former Jedi.

Found a padawan.
Found him!

Found you, Jedi. 
Found you, intruder. 
Found you.
Frail as always!
Free me, Jedi. 
Freeing the oppressed. That's where the passion to keep fighting comes from. 
Friend, huh? Careful, I lost the last one...
Friends of mine?
Friends.
Friends?
Frivolous. 
From Saw?
From my father. My daughter's made it to Chandrila.
From what I've heard, this place still has Imperial activity. Careful, kid.
From what I've learned, the Empire is more places than not.
Fruitless use of power.
Fry 'em!
Fuel tank ignited!
Funny to have this thing end where it started.
Funny, that's exactly how the guy who told me died.
Futile. 
Fwoo be-doo!

Good catch, BD!
Good effort! Remember, we make our own luck.
Good for nothing Jedi.
Good hit!
Good idea, brother. I'm hungry.
Good job, BD. 
Good job.

Good luck out there.
Good luck, Cal.

Good luck... Jedi. May the Force be with you.
Good moves. 
Good one, Padawan.
Good reflexes!

Good scan, BD. 
Good thing they have you.
Good thing we weren't standing there.
Good thing we've got a skilled pilot with us, the storm's still going.
Good timing.
Good to have you on our side.
Good to have you on this quest then.
Good to hear.
Good to know. We've got a lot more flying ahead of us.

Good. Again.
Good. Bide your time. We'll see some more action.
Good. Continue.
Good. Continue. 
Good. Good. Okay. Good luck, buddy.
Good. I was beginning to worry I'd never hear anything.
Good. I'm glad.
Good. Imperial distress calls are going out across the planet.
Good. Its owner would want it that way.
Good. Keep pushing forward. 
Good. Not getting any new activity. 
Good. Now hold still. I need to be careful.
Good. The Empire wants results. Let's deliver.
Good. The outsider will run at the might of our brothers. 
Good. They may be aggressive but it pains me to see them harmed.
Good. They were just in the way.
Good. This is far from over.
Good. We're just reaching them now, but we can't stay long. The Empire's looking for us.
Goodbye.
Goodbye...
Gorgara has gathered her bones.
Got 'em.
Got 'im!
Got a call from Saw. They're almost ready.
Got a fix on him!
Got a flame beetle here.
Got a flame beetle over here.
Got a hit on the target.

Got it.
Got it. 
Got it. Race you there!
Got it. Using walls now. 
Got it. We're on the move.
Got me.
Got no more ranged backup!
Got one!
Got some fancy moves, huh?
Got something for you. 
Got something, buddy?
Got something?
Got the bird and the kid. Pretty good day.
Got to jolt this thing. 
Got to overcharge this. 
Got to say, Greez, this ship has held up despite everything we've put her through.
Got us payin' to maintain our own equipment.
Got you!
Got you.
Got you. 
Got... I got it. 
Gotcha.
Gotcha. 
Gotta admit though, I paid you back in thrills. How many slubs get on the Haxion Brood's most wanted?
Gotta be careful. 
Gotta find a way out of here...
Gotta get down.
Gotta jolt this.
Gotta keep moving.
Gotta move in-between bursts.
Gotta reach that turbolift.
Gotta recharge. 
Gotta reload!
Gotta slice this. 
Gotta survive somehow, kid. Just trying to make a few to get by and maybe have some fun while I'm at it. That a crime?
Gotta take cover.
Gotta unlock this. 
Graaawwlll.
Graawwwl.
Grab some seat. Long as she doesn't try anything funny.
Grahh! Kill him, kill him!
Granted.
Granting her access to a legion...
Grasping opponent.
Grateful.
Grawrrrl?
Great answer. Good to know. And if we don't?
Great job, buddy.
Great timing!
Great work, Jedi.
Great work.
Great.
Great. 
Great. An ice planet. Ugh. Ilum it is. 
Greez and I used to search for blame, too.
Greez got 'em.
Greez has gone outside, for once. Figured I'd take the time to rest.
Greez is a better gardener than I thought.
Greez is a rare find for a pilot: doesn't ask too many questions but we can trust him with our lives.
Greez is acting strange.
Greez is quite the expert when it comes to engineering.
Greez knows what he's doing.
Greez might like these.
Greez still hiding? 
Greez will want these.
Greez worked his magic.
Greez's warming up to BD-1, maybe he'll do the same to Dathomir.
Greez, I'm here!
Greez, c'mon.
Greez, have you ever thought of redecorating?
Greez, let me know if you spot any Imperial activity.
Greez, that's actually very insightful.
Greez, what did you cook? It smells awful. 
Greez, what happened?
Greez, you haven't seen my datapad lying around have you?
Greez, you ready for a tour of Dathomir yet?
Greez.
Greez... are you okay?
Greez?
Greezy money, baby.
Grenade deployed. 
Grenade out!
Grooooowwwl.
Growing up we heard tales of a green, pointy eared, legendary Jedi Master and...
Guerrilla fighters! Wookiees and off-worlders ambushing an Imperial convoy.
Guess I could use a workout.
Guess I'll get all the rewards for this.
Guess I'll go look. 
Guess I'll look into it. 
Guess I'm all that's left.
Guess I'm better than I thought.
Guess I'm looking for a Jedi then.
Guess I'm on my own...
Guess I'm stuck looking for trouble.
Guess I've got no choice, huh?
Guess I've picked up a few things from you, huh, buddy?
Guess he couldn't handle me.
Guess he's just gone?
Guess it's a ranged fight now?
Guess it's all close range now...
Guess it's back to Bogano. 
Guess it's back to Dathomir. 
Guess it's just you and me. 
Guess it's my turn to check.
Guess it's quitting time for this guy. 
Guess it's time to get in close.
Guess it's you and me.
Guess it's you and me. 
Guess that answers that.
Guess that's over.
Guess the bounty is all mine.
Guess the platform isn't here.
Guess they should have been more careful.
Guess this Jedi has a soft spot for nature.
Guess those explode.
Guess we can't just walk in. 
Guess we don't have a choice.
Guess we keep going. 
Guess we need to move in...
Guess we saved each other again.
Guess we should go back on patrol...
Guess we should keep moving huh?
Guess we're on the right track, huh BD?
Guess we're out of heavy support.
Guess we're stuck then.
Guess you can't stop progress.
Guess you made a mistake not killing me on Bracca then.
Guess you'll see back at base. 
Guh!
Gunner down!
Gunner down! Come on! Move up!
Gunner down! Group up. 
Gunner down.
Gunner support down.
Gunner support is down.
Gunner's down. 
Gunners are down.
Gunners are down. Tighten formation. 
Gunners down!
Gunners down.
Gunners, wiped out.
H-he can't...
H... hey!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha, pitiful.
Ha yeah! Die!
Ha yes, I see it.
Ha!
Ha! Block this!
Ha! Classic.
Ha! Coward!
Ha! Get a load of the kid. He thinks we're back in the Clone Wars!
Ha! Got you!
Ha! He meant nothing!
Ha! I did it!
Ha! Look at this coward runnin'!
Ha! Look at this!
Ha! Run! 
Ha! Scared?
Ha! Some Jedi!
Ha! Stronger than you look!
Ha! That's how I feel when I tap into the Force.
Ha! This one has fight!
Ha! Try again!
Ha! Was that a hit?
Ha! We did -
Ha! Well, now I feel unstoppable.
Ha! You are weak!
Ha! You're the best.
Ha, almost got me. 
Ha, alright then. 
Ha, bounced off me. 
Ha, can't feel it. 
Ha, catch me now!
Ha, caught myself!
Ha, good to hear.
Ha, good.
Ha, guess it's a one on one fight now.
Ha, it's okay. I'll believe it once Master Tapal says so. 
Ha, look! He's hurtin'!
Ha, missed!
Ha, take that!
Ha, that was easy!
Ha, too slow!
Ha, too slow. 
Ha, watch 'em bleed!
Ha, you promoted? That'll never happen.
Ha, you're pretty quick. 
Ha. Almost got me. 
Ha. Ha. Very funny. 
Ha. Thank you, BD-1. It makes it much easier if you don't move.
Had a bad feeling I'd see you here.
Had a nice sound to it, don'tcha think?
Had a rough time, Jedi?
Had some trouble, Jedi?
Had to take a shot.
Had your droid not intervened, I would've killed you with ease.
Hah. You're getting weak. 
Hahaha! Die!
Hallikset.
Halt intruder. 
Halt!
Halt! 
Halting attack.
Handle that thing.
Hands in the air!
Hang in there.
Hang on tight.
Hang on!
Hang on, I got this.
Hang on, I think I have one around here.
Hang on, buddy!
Hang on.
Hanging in there, thanks to you.
Hanging in there?
Hard to stay on 'em.
Hardly felt that.
Has Cere not trained you?
Has anyone breached the Fortress before?
Have I mentioned to you how awesome this is?
Have either of you heard of the Partisans?
Have faith, Cal. We'll be in touch with your ship. For the cause.
Have fun in there?
Have the probes been deployed yet?
Have this!
Have to find my way around to the other side.
Have to stay alert. 
Have you checked in with Command today?
Have you ever buried someone you love?
Have you ever encountered a nydak in the swamps?
Have you figured out how to get slyyyg slime off your boots?
Have you had experience with many?
Have you noticed anything in this sector?
Have you really killed a Jedi before?... um, sir.
Have you seen Cere?
Have you seen my rations anywhere?
Have you talked to our captain? I bet he could.
Have you truly learned nothing new?
Haven't gotten myself killed yet. Rather not talk about it.
Haven't had enough gambling for one lifetime?
Haven't seen a Lucrehulk in ages.
Haven't seen one like that before.
Having a good time, BD?
Having a good time?
Having a hard time?
Having trouble?
Having troubles?
Having... issues with combat!
He ain't gonna get away with that here!
He always thought they were interesting - as he did with most ancient cultures.
He always wanted to explore the whole galaxy.
He attacks!
He believed in the future, but can't have a future without the past. 
He believed in you. A lot of people depend on you, even if they don't know it yet.
He bleeds. End it. 
He bleeds. Let's end him. 
He blocked it!
He calls the storm!
He can deflect all shots.
He can heal!
He can reflect!
He can return fire!
He can run on walls...
He can trip us?
He can't be that quick!
He can't beat all of us...
He can't do that! Can he?
He can't get far.
He can't get them all!
He can't handle fighting us.
He can't handle it. 
He can't keep this up.
He can't match us!
He can't reflect them all!
He can?!
He cannot endure!
He cannot have gone far. 
He cared about his work and the future more than anything else; he didn't have the time.
He caught me. 
He causes slipups.
He climbed down over there. 
He climbed up there. 
He clipped me. 
He commands power!
He could have trained more. 
He could not defeat us. 
He could not stand against our might!
He couldn't defeat me. 
He couldn't handle us!
He couldn't stand against us. 
He destroyed our droid support!
He destroyed our droid!
He destroyed our last security droid. 
He destroyed the security droid!
He did not win. Not today. 
He did something. 
He did what he could and left when he couldn't do any more - to fight another day. 
He didn't have a chance. 
He didn't study anything other than Jedi teachings. But he knew a lot about strategy and combat.
He died too quickly. 
He died with honor. 
He disappeared again. 
He disappeared up there. 
He disappeared.
He distracted the Stormtroopers so I could escape with our daughter. He was always impulsive.
He does seem to be warming up to you.
He eliminated all of our ranged troopers.
He eliminated our last rocket trooper. 
He escaped above us. 
He escaped below.
He escaped down there!
He escaped down there. 
He escaped somehow. 
He escaped up there!
He escaped up there. 
He even talks to them.
He fears us too much to fight!
He fears us, Brothers. 
He fears us. 
He figured out range tactic.
He flees from us!
He flees!
He flees! After him!
He flees. We did it, Brothers. 
He got lucky on Kashyyyk.
He got me. 
He got one of us!
He got one of us...
He got our droid but we're still standing. Get him!
He got our droid!
He got our last gunner!
He got our last gunner. What should we do?
He got what was coming to him.
He has evaded us. 
He has his own way of doing things, yes, but these are dire times. We need leadership like Saw's.
He has stims. 
He has to slip up.
He hides behind his guard. 
He is below us!
He is below us. 
He is hiding up there!
He is near. 
He is open!
He is recovering!
He is strong!
He is too far...
He just doesn't stand a chance.
He just got our last gunner!
He just healed! We're doomed!
He just keeps slipping past!
He just killed our last flametrooper...
He just ran away again. 
He just took out a flametrooper!
He just won't die.
He keeps running!
He keeps running.
He keeps running...
He keeps slipping away!
He keeps stopping my attacks.
He killed our droid. Don't let him get you!
He knew he was beat. 
He knew how important it was to learn lessons from the past.
He knows he can't win. 
He looks faint.
He looks injured.
He looks weak.
He looks weak. It's over.
He may be one of the last Jedi, let's savor it.
He may yet return. Stay sharp. 
He mends his wounds! Stop him. 
He mentioned something about the planet Dathomir and a Zeffo homeworld.
He messed with the wrong unit. 
He might escape!
He might need to heal up. 
He might prove to be, but there's more going on here than we know.
He moved. 
He must be around here...
He must be nearby.
He must pay.
He must've run ahead.
He needed someone strong with the Force. I had hoped that BD-1 would recognize that strength and courage.
He ran away down there!
He ran away up there!
He ran off again. 
He ran up there. 
He really believed in the past?
He remains elusive.
He resists you.
He retreats. 
He runs above us. 
He runs from us!
He runs from us, Brothers. 
He runs in fear!
He said it was a real steal and that only he knew how to pilot such a beautiful masterpiece of a machine. 
He said the Mantis was the best luxury cruiser this part of the Galaxy.
He said the bird is the forest's protector. So rare it's nearly legendary.
He said we're all his friends. 
He says he's glad we're in this together.
He seems trustworthy.
He shakes in fear. 
He shouldn't have been so careless!
He slipped away. Above. 
He so fast! 
He stood no chance against us!
He summons the whirlwind.
He swears he saw someone outside the Mantis. Dathomir's getting to him.
He took down our last ranged trooper.
He took down our last rocket trooper. 
He took one of us out!
He took out a rocket trooper! Stop him or you're next!
He took out all of our fighters!
He took out all of our flametroopers!
He took out all our droids. 
He took out all our gunners...
He took out one of us!
He took out our artillery support!
He took out our backup. We'll make him pay. 
He took out our droid. 
He took out our droid...
He took out our flametrooper!
He took out our heavy artillery!
He took out our heavy gunner!
He took out our last flametrooper!
He took out our last heavy gunner...
He took out our melee support. And he's still standing. 
He took out our rocket support by himself!
He took out our rocket support!
He took out our rocket support! Get him!
He trusted you. 
He understands. 
He was a hero.
He was a pretty strange guy...
He was a true guardian of the Republic.
He was always a bastard. But yes, he changed on your arrival. He saw the presence of another Jedi as an opportunity. Or a threat.
He was always a smart man, but he was still figuring things out. Now it's up to us to follow that path.
He was always alone. Even when I was with him.
He was always chasing down one mystery or another.
He was always on the move. Bogano is the first place I ever saw that looked like he settled... even for a brief moment.
He was heading into the caves... He called out, but I couldn't find him.
He was just gone.
He was killed by a cave-in. Imperial excavation is making these tunnels unstable.
He was lacking. 
He was looking for a Zeffo artifact. Finding it could help save the Jedi.
He was part of Tarfful's crew, but got captured on a mission.
He was right about you.
He was too fast for me. 
He was too weak to stop you. 
He was weak!
He was... strong. Since the day I stepped foot on Bracca, he watched over me. Never complained...
He wasn't trained. 
He went above us. 
He went below us. 
He went down there!
He went down there. 
He went somewhere...
He went there. Up there. 
He went up there right?
He went up there!
He went up there. 
He went upward.
He will be dead before he reaches us. 
He will fall before us. 
He will kill us all if we let him. 
He will pay for that.
He will run out of stims. Just wait. 
He won't be getting back up.
He won't escape.
He won't forget us. 
He won't last.
He won't stand still!
He won't.
He would not last long, I think.
He'll be back. 
He'll be back...
He'll be dead soon anyway.
He'll be terminated soon enough.
He'll come down... eventually. 
He'll come for us next...
He'll make you misstep.
He'll slip up!
He's THE freedom fighter.
He's a freedom fighter?
He's a goner!
He's a quick one!
He's above us!
He's above.
He's above. 
He's actually pretty skilled...
He's afraid of a real fight. 
He's almost dead!
He's almost done.
He's almost down!
He's almost down. 
He's around here. Look out. 
He's badly injured!
He's below!
He's beneath us!
He's better off not knowing.
He's bleeding! Let's finish this. 
He's blocking everything!
He's blocking me!
He's blocking me. 
He's blocking my blows.
He's blocking us. 
He's blocking. 
He's captured me somehow. 
He's catching our bolts. 
He's come like they all have before. Just be ready.
He's crippled our ranged support!
He's damaged! Get him!
He's damaged.
He's dangerous.
He's dangerous. That was our last rocket trooper. 
He's dead!
He's deflecting bolts.
He's destroyed all our security droids.
He's destroyed our droid.
He's dodging fast. 
He's dodging. 
He's dodgy.
He's done it!
He's down below.
He's down there!
He's down there.
He's down there. 
He's down!
He's down... Are there others?
He's evading. 
He's fading. 
He's fast.
He's fierce. 
He's fighting a losing battle. I doubt freedom for the Wookiees is his only goal.
He's finished!
He's fled us.
He's fleeing, Brothers. 
He's fleeing. 
He's fleeing. Track him!
He's getting lucky. 
He's getting weak. 
He's going down!
He's going to end us all!
He's going to get away!
He's going to kill us all!
He's going to recover!
He's gone again...
He's gone!
He's gone. Again. 
He's gone. He's gone. That's it. 
He's gone. We're safe. Right?
He's gone...
He's gonna get me!
He's gonna kill me!
He's gonna wipe us out!
He's got a solid guard.
He's got a stim!
He's got me trapped!
He's got me!
He's got quick blocks. 
He's got some skill!
He's got some skill. 
He's got stims!
He's got stims. 
He's got timing.
He's grievously hurt!
He's hard to track!
He's has stims!
He's here!
He's here! And injured!
He's here! I'm ready for you, traitor!
He's here.
He's here. Inform the Inquisitor!
He's here. Looks hurt. 
He's hiding above us!
He's hiding below.
He's hiding down there. 
He's hiding up there. 
He's hit!
He's hit. 
He's hit. End him. 
He's hurt!
He's hurt! 
He's hurt! Yes!
He's hurt.
He's hurt. 
He's hurt. Good. 
He's hurt. Let's end him. 
He's hurting now!
He's hurting. 
He's hurting. Easy prey. 
He's in my sights.
He's in the zone.
He's injured brothers!
He's injured! Let's end him. 
He's injured, good.
He's injured. 
He's injured. End it. 
He's just dead...
He's just gonna keep recovering...
He's just too far.
He's just too fast. He took out our flametrooper!
He's just too good.
He's killed all of our gunners!
He's killed our gunners.
He's killed our heavy support.
He's killed our last flametrooper!
He's killed our last gunner.
He's killing everyone!
He's killing us!
He's limber.
He's looking pretty hurt. 
He's making you look like fools!
He's mending his wounds!
He's mending his wounds. 
He's mine!
He's mine.

He's using the Force.

He's with us.

He's withdrawing.

Heading out.
Heading out. 
Heading over there. 
Heading towards the surface. Be ready.
Heads down. Taking a shot. 
Heads up!
Hear that?
Hear that? Sounds like someone is home after all.
Heard Saw's hoping to find some news of Tarfful at the refinery.
Heard a noise.
Heard about the skirmish on Zeffo.
Heard something nearby.
Heard that.
Heard the target messed up some bounty hunters!
Heard they made more progress at the site.

Heck of a storm brewing down there. This might not be the best time to land.
Heh heh, you won't leave.
Heh! Glad you're on board.
Heh! He wasn't so tough!
Heh, I doubt it. War zones are bad for business.
Heh, just like great-grandma... whaddya want, Cal?
Heh, just like great-grandma...whaddya want, Cal?
Heh, me too.
Heh, some Jedi, right?
Heh, some Jedi.
Heh, tell me about it.
Heh, we've been through some hell together.
Heh.
Heh. Are you even trying?
Heh. Good job, rookie. Keep it up. 
Heh. Heh.
Heh. Heh. Heh.
Heh. I doubt it but I've been wrong before. That Lateron never ceases to amaze me. 
Heh. I guess so.
Heh. I'll be fine, Cere. Plus, I've got BD with me.
Heh. Keep it up, then.
Heh. Like that time we were mistaken for smugglers?
Heh. Nothing. Just kidding.
Heh. Or maybe not. 
Heh. She sure is. 
Heh. That's true. I do look young for my age.
Heh. Think she can handle it? 
Heh. We're winning this. 
Heh. What an honor.
Heh. You're right, they aren't good blasters. Aim must be off. 
Heh... Yeah, that's true.
Hell happened?
Hello, BD-1. I am Merrin.
Hello?
Help me Master Kestis!
Help me get through!
Help me move this thing.
Help me now!
Help me out here!
Help me out here. 
Help me with this.
Help me!
Help me! Brothers!
Help me! Here!
Help me, BD!
Help me, BD-1.
Help me, please!
Help me? How?
Help please!
Help us!

Help! Help!
Help! Someone help!
Help! Stim!
Help, BD!
Help, please!
Help.
Help. BD-1!
Helpless cretins!
Helpless, as always.
Her howls were fierce.
Her shadow is best to be avoided.
Her words not mine... but I loved her.
Here I go!
Here I go. 
Here I thought your greatest virtue was your dogged persistence as you stumble from one debacle to the next.
Here comes a flyer.
Here comes a grenade. 
Here he is, chief.
Here it comes!
Here it goes. 
Here it is.
Here to begin your training?
Here we go again!
Here we go!
Here we go, BD.
Here we go.
Here we go. Zeffo. 
Here you go!
Here you go, bud.
Here you go.
Here! Kill the slyyyg!
Here! The Jedi!
Here! The enemy. 
Here's another one, BD. 
Here, I got ya a little something to show my appreciation.
Here, buddy!
Here, hop on board.
Here. Our mark. 
Hey - witch lady. Look, uh, don't use your tricks in my ship. Please.
Hey BD, let's check it out.
Hey BD.
Hey BD. Want another stim module?
Hey Cal! I'll meet you at the clamps.
Hey Cere, I'm under an Imperial dig site. They got a lot further than we thought.
Hey Cere, do you have a favorite memory with Cordova?
Hey Cere.
Hey Greez!
Hey Greez, what's this thing?
Hey Greez, you busy?
Hey Greez.
Hey Merrin.
Hey bud! Stim!
Hey buddy!
Hey buddy.
Hey down there!
Hey kid, nice one on the seed collecting, but the terrarium's still got plenty of room.
Hey look at that.
Hey now!
Hey stormtrooper, how do you handle that?
Hey there buddy.
Hey there!
Hey there, BD-1.
Hey up there!
Hey wasn't there a gigantic crashed ship on Zeffo? Think there's any good loot in that thing?
Hey who's that?
Hey!
Hey! 
Hey! An intruder!
Hey! BD. Let's go!
Hey! Come down here!
Hey! Come down!
Hey! Come here!
Hey! Come over here. 
Hey! Did you see that?
Hey! Get out here!
Hey! He's above us!
Hey! He's down below!
Hey! He's down there!
Hey! Intruder!
Hey! It's okay! We're not here to hurt you.
Hey! Look in here!
Hey! Look!
Hey! Our bounty!
Hey! The Jedi!
Hey! Uh... wait up.
Hey! Who are you?
Hey! Who asked you!?
Hey! Who's that?
Hey! Who's there?
Hey! Who's there?!
Hey! You there!
Hey! You!
Hey! You! Come here!
Hey! You! Identify yourself!
Hey! You're fast, huh?
Hey! it's him!
Hey, BD!
Hey, BD-1!
Hey, BD-1.
Hey, BD-1. I've got another stim for you.
Hey, BD-1?
Hey, BD. 
Hey, BD. A little help?
Hey, BD. In here.
Hey, BD. Take a look.
Hey, BD. What's this?
Hey, BD?
Hey, Cal.
Hey, Cal. When you were in the arena, you didn't meet a Jumbaco did you? Great guy, maybe a little rough around the edges.
Hey, Cal. You and her... is everything alright?
Hey, Cal...
Hey, Cere, ever seen something like this Vault before?
Hey, Cordova mentioned something about peace in the eye of the storm?
Hey, Greez.
Hey, I get it. But she's trying the best she can. 
Hey, I hope you get in there and you find that holo-thing.
Hey, I know we haven't been on great terms but can I talk to you about something?
Hey, I know you probably think I know everything, but I don't know much about Jedi.
Hey, I ran into some Stormtroopers. The Empire is on Zeffo.
Hey, I ran into some Stormtroopers. The Empire is on Zeffo. 
Hey, I recognize this band.
Hey, I'll take it as long as I don't have to do extra work.
Hey, I'm a positive guy, too. I'm positive that if I die, I'll be very upset. 
Hey, Prauf.
Hey, a chest! Think the Jedi would mind if we grabbed supplies?
Hey, buddy. Stim?
Hey, buddy?
Hey, clamp it.
Hey, didn't we see one of these spheres on the way in?
Hey, do me a favor.
Hey, down there!
Hey, got no more close-range guys!
Hey, he's up there!
Hey, how's that diet going? I'm just kidding.
Hey, hurry up! We're close to finishing ahead of schedule!
Hey, it wasn't all that bad, right Cal? Didn't you get to hitch a sweet ride with one of the locals.
Hey, it's okay to be excited.
Hey, it's our mark!
Hey, kid, I've been meaning to thank you.
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid. Don't lead those troopers to us. Get movin'.
Hey, listen to me!
Hey, listen?
Hey, more seeds for Greez!
Hey, my helmet was fogged up last night! On account of the... the fog.
Hey, no fair!
Hey, no problem. Well, I'll be, you know, right here if you need me.
Hey, now!
Hey, over here!
Hey, so how come you don't play that uh... what do you call that? That instrument?
Hey, someone in there?
Hey, stop that!
Hey, stormtrooper. Snap out of it. 
Hey, thanks!
Hey, that was pretty brave.
Hey, they've been through a lot. Stress may be good for building character, not so good for plants.
Hey, uh, thanks. For everything.
Hey, wake up.
Hey, watch it!
Hey, watch yourself.
Hey, we should get movin'.
Hey, what's that?
Hey, where'd you go?
Hey, who's that?
Hey, why don't you cut her some slack?
Hey, you better bring me along, Cal. I ain't a big fan of wildlife, but I bet that thing's got some serious speed.
Hey, you don't need to call this in.
Hey, you hear me?
Hey, you okay?!
Hey, you really should watch what you say.
Hey, you're not listening to me though.
Hey.
Hey. Come on out. 
Hey. Identify yourself. 
Hey. Jedi's down there. 
Hey. Look down there. 
Hey. Look up there. 
Hey... Well yeah, alright, kinda, I guess. Whatever! I've got enough friends.
Hey... you! Stop!
Heya!
Hi BD-1.
Hi BD.
Hi chuba da nago?!
Hi there BD.
Hi there!
Hi to you too. You two must have spent a lot of time together alone on that planet.
Hide out here?
Hiding back there?
Hiding behind your saber?
Hiding down there?
Hiding from Merrin?
Higher ability than expected. 
Higher ground won't hide you.
His Master died in his arms. He buried her the best he could.
His fear rules him. 
His guard is up.
His guard's too solid!
His guard's too tight!
His name was Prauf. Traded his life for mine. 
His reason won't matter when I get to him.
His sword... so swift! His strength... so potent!
Hit 'em quick!
Hit 'em!
Hit 'em. 
Hit 'em. Blastin' again.
Hit him again!
Hit him already!
Hit him hard. 
Hit him now!
Hit him with something!
Hit him!
Hit him, now!
Hit him. 
Hit it!
Hit it, BD!
Hit me again!
Hit me!
Hit the Jedi. 
Hit the switch.
Hit their nest!
Hiya, BD.
Hm, oh, uhh...
Hm. Alright, I'll do more investigating. If I find something, I'll let you know.
Hm. Cere, Greez.
Hm. Oh. Tough break. I take it back. You're alright, buddy.
Hm... The more I think about it: I may already be a Legend.
Hmm, perhaps I chose the wrong Padawan.
Hmm. That didn't take long.
Hmm...
Hmm... Well...
Hmmm, where to?
Hmmm.
Hmmm. 
Hmmm. I think next...
Hmmm...
Hmmmm. 
Hold him back!
Hold it! Come here!
Hold it! Don't move.
Hold it.
Hold on BD!
Hold on!
Hold on, BD!
Hold on, BD-1! I'm coming!
Hold on, BD.
Hold on, I'm on my way!
Hold on, rookie. Let's take another look. 
Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute. A holo-what?
Hold on, y-you know the Jedi?
Hold on. 
Hold on. I need cover. 
Hold on...
Hold position!
Hold position.
Hold steady, stormtroopers.
Hold still!
Hold that thought.
Hold the line.
Hold this room. I'll search the area.
Hold your fire.
Hold!
Hold. 
Hold. Gunner down.
Hold. Movement. 
Holding up okay?
Holding up, Greez?
Holocron.
Home. Yeah, I get that.
Honestly, I had no idea this was here when I pulled the bridge down.
Hopa!? Sorc Tormo killee uba, shag poodoo!
Hope I'm not next...
Hope our commanders saw this. 
Hope that wasn't a close one. 
Hope these don't freak Greez out.
Hope they're sturdy.
Hope this pans out.
Hope we don't regret this.
Hope will always survive in those who continue to fight.
Hope you're ready for a brawl. 
Hope you're ready. 
Hope you're steady!
Hope you're watching Greez.
Hope... still burns.
Hopefully he was right. 
Hopefully it buys us some time.
Hopefully it's my mark.
Hopefully that helps your skill.
Hopefully that'll be the last one.
Hopefully they all made it out alive.
Horrifying.
Hostile above!
Hostile approaching!
Hostile deceased.
Hostile detected.
Hostile exterminated.
Hostile is mobile.
Hostile marked.
Hostile on the wall.
Hostile reviving.
Hostile ricocheting assault.
Hostile spotted.
Hostile still present.
Hostile under us!
Hostile underneath us!
Hostile, get ready!
How about this?
How am I supposed to hit him?
How are we going to stop a Jedi anyway?
How are we honestly supposed to defeat a Jedi with just a blaster?
How are we supposed to find rebels here? It's huge and dark and there's creatures everywhere.
How are we supposed to hit him?
How are we supposed to win without artillery?
How are you doing that?
How are you holding up?
How are you...
How are your plants doing, Greez?
How boring.
How can he do that?
How can he do this?
How can we stand against that?
How can we stop the candles from getting doused?
How can we win?
How can you do this?
How can you not see that?
How can you say that?
How come you're no longer a Jedi?
How could I forget? You told them we were delivering a shipment of Kaadu ribs.
How could one target take out an entire bounty hunter syndicate?
How did I even do that?
How did he do that?
How did he even...
How did he....
How did someone sneak in?
How did that happen?
How did we do that?
How did we find the Jedi? I heard he was hiding out on some planet... pretending to be a citizen of the Empire.
How did you become a guerilla fighter?
How did you ever get involved with that guy?
How did you kill them all?
How do I get there?
How do I know you won't try to kill me? Again.
How do those things with the horns keep getting past our perimeter? 
How do we get him?
How do we get to him?
How do you know so much about the Nightsister?
How do you know so much?
How do you learn so much about these places you explore?
How do you like this?
How do you remember all the protocols?
How does he do that?
How does he keep evading us?
How does that Nightsister keep following us?
How even...!?
How even...?
How far out have you been?
How fierce?
How is he doing that?
How is he...
How is that possible?
How is this possible?
How long before she cracks and betrays you too?
How long can he hold out?
How long do you think you can hide?
How long have you been fighting? 
How long have you been here?
How long were you watching me, anyway?
How many crawlers have you seen today?
How many hits does it take?
How many nydaks have you slain?
How many of the creatures out there actually eat little Laterons like me?
How many were left but mostly they wanted to know about...
How many wyyyschokk have you killed?
How much current can you conduct?
How nimble.
How predictable.
How quiet it is. I don't know if it's because Greez is off the ship or something else...
How strong?
How trite.
How would I even stop a Jedi?
How would you know that?
How ya doin'?
How you doin' so far?
How you holdin' up? Being back here n' all.
How'd I miss?
How'd insurgents get ahold of a heavy troop transport?
How'd you get down there?
How'd you get here?
How'd you get up here?
How'd you know that would work?
How're you doing that?
How're you feeling, BD-1?
How's he blocking everything?
How's he doing that?
How's it feel to be home?
How's it feel to be hunted?
How's it feel, Jedi?
How's it feel... to bleed?
How's it going buddy?
How's it going, BD?
How's it going?
How's our hull looking?
How's that feel?
How's that possible?
How's that?
How?
How?!
Howsabout you 'liberate' one of those things from the Empire and I take it for a spin?
Huh, another one of these. Wonder if they connect.
Huh, there was something in there.
Huh, wish I could fly.
Huh. He ran away.
Huh. That was a Jedi?
Huh. That's it?
Huh. This also says wind can move them around.
Huh?
Huh? No, not mine. Not the Mantis. No way. I'm just sayin', you should try it sometime, but with someone else's ship. 
Huh? Not my job to do that. But if it means anything, I don't take just any gig. She's a good one. 
Huh? Oh. Yes. Just planning my next move.
Huh? There's a wind shaft behind this wall.
Huh? Ugh, I lost track. Trying to remember if I watered my plants... Do you mind?
Huh? Was that...?
Huh? What's that, sir?
Huh?!
Hungry fellas?
Hunt him down!
Hunted down by the Empire. I...
Hurry Cal - they'll be closing in on our position.
Hurry and blast him!
Hurry and help me!
Hurry and kill him!
Hurry up here. I'm hungry. Might try a new recipe for Smoked Kaadu Ribs.
Hurry up, buddy!
Hurry up, this place gives me the creeps.
Hurry up, you're boring me!
Hurry up.
Hurry!
Hurry! Before he escapes!
Hurry! Before it explodes!
Hurry! Catch him!
Hurry! End it!
Hurry! Get him!
Hurry! Kill him!
Hurry! Take him down!
Hurry! We gotta finish before they start cutting this wing!
Hurry. Get him. 
Hurry. We need reinforcements!
Hurt a bit, didn't it?
Hurt, Jedi?
Hurtin'?
Hurting, Jedi?
Hurting?
Hustle up, Cal.
I actually got him. 
I added his hilt to mine. I want to keep a piece of him with us.
I admire that.
I admire your commitment. Soon, I hope I can live up to your example.
I admired them. When I became a seeker I got to see a few in person.
I agree, he talks too much.
I agree.
I agree. This place is special.
I aim to kill. We will succeed.
I ain't in the mood to talk right now, just lemme know when you're ready to get outta here.
I almost feel sorry for that bog rat.
I already know. 
I already tried it. It's all useless in this muck.
I always get picked for solo duty...
I always have. Ever since I was a Youngling, I trusted in the Force.
I always remain disciplined until the orders have been completely carried out. 
I am Master Eno Cordova. I may not know your name but I know your purpose.
I am aware of my surroundings and prepared for any scenario.
I am done with your games. 
I am glad you didn't. It is nice to have an ally.
I am going to end you. 
I am listening.
I am looking for it you mean.
I am not convinced our magick is all that different from your  'Force'.
I am not having it - I will find out what's going on! 
I am not losing this. 
I am not. I never know what to expect with your crew. I like that.
I am ready for this. 
I am ready for you. 
I am ready to resume.
I am still here, though. So that's got to mean somethin'.
I am terminating your life.
I am the Emperor's will. 
I am what Cere made me.
I am your opponent. 
I am. 
I am. No outsider will stop us.
I am. Whatever it takes.
I apologize. Understood, sir. I know my orders.
I appreciate the help.
I appreciate the offer but please understand the idea of using the Force is dangerous to me.
I await our next conflict.
I been workin' with you some time now.
I believe BD-1 was left for me to find.
I believe I can't keep hiding from the Empire, so I don't really have a choice.
I believe in Saw.
I believe in the Force and I believe in the Jedi. I always have.
I believe in this quest.
I believe in you, as I always have. If another Jedi comes to Bogano, you will be their guide. 
I believe in you.
I believe it allows a Force wielder to perceive the mysteries of the Vault.
I believe most Inquisitors were Jedi, turned through torture and fear.
I believe studying this sphere may yield the information I need to discover who they were and why they built such a landmark.
I believe that Vault holds the key to rebuilding the Jedi Order.
I believe that rebuilding the Order is the best chance we have against the Empire.
I believe this Astrium was once a ubiquitous, sacred symbol. Perhaps even linked to the Vault.
I believe you know our next challengers...
I believe you will find someone just as brave and persistent as you have been.
I believed that the darkness on Dathomir was dangerous. That's all I needed to know to stay away...but here we are.
I bet BD-1 wouldn't mind helping you fix some things around here.
I bet I can jump from wall to wall.
I bet I could beat you...
I bet he runs away from us. 
I bet he runs. 
I bet that's what they thought on Kashyyyk.
I bet we can do it too.
I bet you never thought you'd team up with a Jedi, huh?
I bet you're feeling tired now.
I bet you're going to tell me.
I bet.
I better check this out. 
I blame this rain. Makes everything act up.
I botched that...
I bring you death!
I came to Kashyyyk once with Cordova... it didn't look like this, that's for sure. 
I can almost smell the outsider's fear. 
I can always count on you.
I can barely stand against him.
I can beat him.
I can catch you!
I can defeat you!
I can do this all day.
I can do this if you just cover me. 
I can do this!
I can do this.
I can eat as fast as you want me to. Let me know when you're ready.
I can feel it inside of her.
I can feel it, it's calling to me! We must be close.
I can feel something pulling me there, beyond the storm.
I can feel your anger.
I can fix it up. You think I can't?
I can get a clear shot.
I can get him. 
I can get through.
I can go no further. I must return to Zeffo.
I can handle it.
I can handle it. 
I can handle myself. 
I can help you with that.
I can help.
I can imagine what they'd do to the remains of this ancient Force-sensitive culture.
I can imagine. From what I've seen here, the Zeffo left a lot to learn from.
I can just 'bout taste the credits.
I can only trust this holocron to someone who has followed my path and understands.
I can see that. 
I can see that. I'm glad you believe in what we are trying to accomplish.
I can see why the Emperor is so interested in this location.
I can see why the Empire has such confidence in you. It's an honor, sir.
I can see you trembling from here.
I can see you trying to escape
I can see you two have been through a lot. It's not easy...
I can see you up there. 
I can sense the doom of the Jedi Order is upon us.
I can sense your fear.
I can smell our new rule. It's close. 
I can smell the spider drool.
I can smell your fear. 
I can stop you.
I can take my blaster apart and put it back together in less than 12 seconds.
I can take you myself.
I can take you out. No problem.
I can take you there on one condition.
I can triumph. 
I can wait as long as it takes!
I can wait, Jedi.
I can wait.
I can't argue with that. But, I mean, this lightsaber thing. That's somethin' else.
I can't believe it. He's dead.
I can't believe this is it...
I can't believe we actually beat a Jedi. 
I can't believe we got it.
I can't believe you lost him!
I can't break free. 
I can't catch him.
I can't catch the target!
I can't change what I did no more than you can change what happened to your Master.
I can't do this by myself.
I can't do this without cover. 
I can't do this!
I can't escape. 
I can't explain, BD. Not sure I even understand.
I can't fail!
I can't fight anymore!
I can't get a good angle!
I can't get a good hit!
I can't get a response.
I can't get a solid hit!
I can't get down!
I can't get down. 
I can't get him!
I can't get it off!
I can't get it to work.
I can't get over there!
I can't get through!
I can't get through. 
I can't get up there.
I can't grab that.
I can't hit him!
I can't hit him.
I can't hit you from here!
I can't hold on...
I can't jump that high.
I can't keep doing this...
I can't keep eyes on him!
I can't keep eyes on him. 
I can't keep this up.
I can't keep track of him!
I can't kill you from here. 
I can't land a hit!
I can't land a hit.
I can't let him get through again.
I can't make egress to the target.
I can't make it over there. We've gotta find another way.
I can't move at all. 
I can't move this.
I can't move. 
I can't open it.
I can't reach him from here. 
I can't reach him!
I can't reach him. 
I can't reach that.
I can't reach the target.
I can't reach you!
I can't see! Hold it still!
I can't stand it here! Too many things creeping in the shadows. 
I can't stop him!
I can't stop it!
I can't take much more.
I can't tell what that was. 
I can't wait to collect on you. 
I can't wait to end you. 
I can't wait to get paid for this. 
I can't wait to get some more action. I'm ready! Bring it on!
I can't wait to kill you.
I can't watch!
I can't. Lives are at stake.
I cannot be defeated.
I cannot fight from here... 
I cannot imagine a Dathomirian beast befriending someone.
I cannot lose my Brother's trust...
I cannot move!
I cannot reach him!
I caught you. 
I chose to rest instead. That's how I prepare.
I clean. The droid messes it up. Is that how it's going to be all the time?
I copy you.
I copy.
I could ask you the same thing.
I could do without the extra scrutiny.
I could have helped him.
I could kill this thing with my eyes closed. 
I could look at these all day.
I could never understand what you went through.
I could only intercept fragments of information about what they're doing here,
I could see the light reflect off it, calling to me.
I could take him myself.
I could use a stim.
I could use some help out there if you want to join me.
I could use some time to my own thoughts.
I could use some time to think. 
I couldn't forgive myself.
I couldn't have found the Astrium without her. We fought Malicos together.
I couldn't have won without you.
I couldn't save him.
I couldn't sit back and watch it happen, so I joined the cause.
I couldn't stop him from getting our last rocket trooper. 
I damaged him!
I dare them.
I defeated the Ninth Sister.
I did it!
I did it.
I did it? I did it!
I did. I wanted to see how you would handle Malicos.
I did. Why do you ask?
I didn't bring warm enough clothes for Ilum. 
I didn't discover Cal, if that's what you're thinking.
I didn't even ask. I never wanted to know. That was my mantra: the less I know, the better...
I didn't hear anything, but my meditation helps me focus out many distractions. 
I didn't hear anything. Did you? 
I didn't know you cared that much about nature.
I didn't know you spoke Shyriiwook.
I didn't like watching that.
I didn't need backup anyway.
I didn't realize the Jedi taught cowardice.
I didn't run! I was getting a better vantage point. 
I didn't search the whole ship. But it didn't look like there were any survivors.
I didn't see the skungus there or I wouldn't have shot it!
I didn't see you training this morning with the rest of us. 
I didn't sign up to fight Jedi.
I do hope you do.
I do mind.
I do not believe that.
I do not fear death, Jedi!
I do not understand your words.
I do not watch others sleep.
I do. She flies at midday. Very troubling.
I don't blame you. You were alone on Bracca a long time,
I don't care if they're a Jedi, a Wookiee, or a Bogling, I'm going to destroy them.
I don't care who gets the kill as long as the Jedi is gone. 
I don't care who he's with. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get oil stains out of potolli-weave fabric?
I don't care who they are. New. Old. They're traitors and I will make them suffer for what they did to our galaxy.
I don't care. 
I don't doubt, I hope. The stronger the better.
I don't even wanna think about it. We'll just report back, tell 'em we didn't find anything.
I don't have all day.
I don't keep count. 
I don't know about that. 
I don't know how a Jedi could have gotten in there.
I don't know how we're getting out of this one, buddy.
I don't know how we're gonna get down from this.
I don't know how you're gonna do it, kid, but if there's one thing I've learned about you...
I don't know if I'd say that. 
I don't know if I'll ever be ready.
I don't know if I'm even worried anymore, kid. I think I've hit a limit.
I don't know if I'm ready to take on the galaxy.
I don't know if we can win.
I don't know if you heard, but... I cook.
I don't know many places that did.
I don't know much, but Cordova told me the Nightbrothers serve the Witches of Dathomir. You're lucky to be alive, Cal.
I don't know what I'd do if one of those... things started flying at me.
I don't know what to do! 
I don't know what you're saying.
I don't know what's going on between you and her.
I don't know what's got Second Sister thinking you're so important.
I don't know where he went. 
I don't know where she's taking it.
I don't know why they make us wear these things, I want the Jedi to see my face when I kill him.
I don't know! You'd have to ask them!
I don't know, Greez.
I don't know, but I don't like it.
I don't know, sort of Jedi people. Way to make me feel better, Cere.
I don't know.
I don't know. Could you for once stop talking?
I don't know. I heard my great-grandma say it once. But you don't have to know what a thing does to fix it.
I don't know. Is it? Cere seems concerned about your gambling. 
I don't know. It's not a normal sound the Mantis makes. Sounded like it came from inside, too.
I don't know. Sounds like it could be. Laterons never really had sayings; they were more doers than talkers.
I don't know. That's not what's important right now.
I don't know. There was a transmissi-ugh!
I don't know. We never trained for this.
I don't know. Why?
I don't like crawlers creeping up on me.
I don't like our odds if we run into the enemy.
I don't like the look the look of this thing. Don't touch it.
I don't like this!
I don't like where this is going...
I don't mean just here.
I don't mean to bother you, sir, but are we sure there's an actual Jedi coming here? 
I don't mind. I enjoy guard duty!
I don't need another set of hands. Just please keep your eyes on the scanner. Please?
I don't need any fighters between me and my target.
I don't need help to kill you!
I don't need them.
I don't need them. 
I don't need you alive!
I don't need your gambling habit causing us more trouble with murderous criminal syndicates.
I don't need your help.
I don't remember seeing you there.
I don't see anything.
I don't take orders from you. 
I don't think I can hit a target moving that fast...
I don't think it works like that.
I don't think it's gonna give us a choice.
I don't think it's working.
I don't think she will. She's stayed put long enough. I was always interested in exploring the Galaxy when I was younger,
I don't think so, hearing reports of blaster fire. Keep your guard up.
I don't think that's strange at all.
I don't think these tools are gonna make it through the shift!
I don't think we have a choice. 
I don't think we should be out hunting Jedi.
I don't think we're alone here...
I don't think we've got enough firepower to defeat a Jedi.
I don't understand. What changed?
I don't wanna die here!
I don't wanna die!
I don't want to be here!
I don't want to die like this!
I don't want to hurt you. 
I don't want to know if something's over here.
I don't want to stay here long, BD.
I don't want to train all those younglings alone.
I don't, but that doesn't mean I can't have a conversation.
I don't. I just know.
I don't. I only pull those moves when I'm in danger and need to escape...so let's try to avoid that, kid. 
I doubt it. Even if they survived the crash, the Empire would've taken them out.
I doubt that.
I doubt they expected us to come back.
I drink a magick potion that allows me to travel unseen.
I dunno, but here you are. Alive and kicking despite the odds. Better make it count.
I envy the experiences you have ahead:
I expected more, Jedi.
I expected more.
I expected that!
I failed you.
I failed.
I feel like I haven't slept in days.
I feel like I'm surrounded by ghosts.
I feel like this war with the insurgents will never end.
I feel like we can use the lift again. What do you think, buddy?
I feel the Force all around this place.
I feel the pull...
I feel your fear!
I feel your uncertainty.
I felt that one.
I felt the heat...
I felt the same way about leaving Bracca. The world can feel small when you're trapped by the past.
I fight for Dathomir. 
I fight for my brothers.
I fixed it instead, cheaper!
I found a trail of poison.
I found him!
I found him. 
I found him. Look up. 
I found it. But...
I found my quarry.
I found our bounty. 
I found our target!
I found our target. 
I found out target.
I found something. 
I found the Jedi!
I found the Jedi.
I found the target. 
I found the tomb of a Zeffo Sage.
I found you!
I found you! Are you okay?!
I found you, intruder!
I found you. 
I get it, Cal. But right now, you need to keep pushing forward. We have to pick our fights wisely. And you're still out a working lightsaber. 
I get it. Too busy on the task to worry about yourself. I do the same thing all the time.
I get that now.
I get the point. I'll see if I can find more.
I got a hit. 
I got him!
I got him.
I got him. I got him!
I got it!
I got it.
I got it? I got it!
I got that feeling in the pit of my stomach that, you know... I-I don't know what's going on.
I got this.
I got this. 
I got this. Maybe?
I got you now. 
I got you!
I gotta be quicker. 
I gotta get going.
I greatly enjoyed that kill.
I grow bored.
I grow tired of waiting for instruction from the Sister. This intruder must be dealt with.
I guess I won. Heh. 
I guess he got away.
I guess he's below?
I guess he's just gone?
I guess it's a ranged battle now? 
I guess it's about time I find out who I am.
I guess it's just me now.
I guess it's just our lucky day.
I guess it's... time to fight. 
I guess so...
I guess that's me. 
I guess that's one way to get the claws.
I guess that's true. And that one was pretty tough.
I guess the lift doesn't work from here.
I guess the platform is somewhere else.
I guess we actually found something. 
I guess we can go to Dathomir. 
I guess we should just blast first.
I guess we'll see who survives and who doesn't. 
I guess we're out of ranged support?
I guess you do, Greez.
I guess you were the someone I was supposed to meet.
I guess.
I had an experience that...
I had heard you were all dead.
I had it handled, but no! One-a the roughest cantinas in the galaxy and this one gets us kicked out for fighting.
I had some training with this thing...it's been a while, but some things you never forget.
I hate these pests!
I hate this cold! I hate these caves! Why are we here?
I hate this place. Gives me the creeps.
I have a bad feeling I know.
I have a feeling they'll be useful.
I have a few ideas that don't include life or death situations.
I have destroyed this thing.
I have eyes on the small Padawan! He's in the turbolift.
I have finally found an intact representation of this sacred Zeffo artifact.
I have heard the word Sith once before. My sisters sent assassins after one right before we were attacked.
I have heard you.
I have him!
I have lost visual contact. 
I have lost visual of the target.
I have missed.
I have my doubts.
I have my own path.
I have no desire-
I have no idea.
I have placed inside this Vault a Jedi holocron.
I have seen your companions.
I have the holocron, but Cere...
I have the holocron.
I have to catch him!
I haven't been keeping full count, but I'm sure I've got to make good on my job.
I haven't really thought about it.
I haven't seen machinery like this since Bracca.
I hear a possible threat. 
I hear an intruder.
I hear something. 
I hear they're finding all types of things.
I hear ya, BD. Let me see. 
I hear you back there. 
I hear you sneaking over there!
I hear you!
I hear you, but there's something over here I want to explore.
I hear you.
I hear you. 
I heard Jedi can do things no one can. How do we even have a chance?
I heard a Jedi can reflect blasts. So you're just making it easier for him.
I heard he was up on Nar Shaddaa?
I heard it was quite the victory.
I heard once the Empire finds that Wookiee leader Tarfful, the rest will fall in line. 
I heard something open up.
I heard something. 
I heard something. Confirm?
I heard that. 
I heard the Jedi's traveling with a Lateron. Now that's a challenge.
I heard the Second Sister faced off with the Jedi.
I heard the outsider is a Jedi. 
I heard the target escaped.
I heard there could be many more Jedi hiding throughout the galaxy.
I heard this thing coming a mile away. 
I heard we're getting new orders soon.
I heard you!
I heard you. 
I heard. They plan to bring Zeffo artifacts to Coruscant.
I hit him!
I hit him.... Why did I do that?
I hold in my hand a piece of galactic history.
I hope I get to see that sometime.
I hope all outsiders get that message. 
I hope he doesn't come back...
I hope he's down for good. 
I hope it doesn't get up.
I hope it's really dead.
I hope not. 
I hope reinforcements are on the way.
I hope so.
I hope so. 
I hope so. I hate this planet.
I hope that hurt!
I hope this hits!
I hope to one day return and search for the Shyyyo with Tarfful.
I hope we don't end up on another isolated rock.
I hope we don't run into any insurgents...
I hope we fight together again.
I hope we find you a new scomp link soon.
I hope we run into an animal or a rebel or... something soon.
I hope we survive this...
I hope we're ready.
I hope we're so lucky next time. 
I hope you do. 
I hope you're right, BD-1.
I hope you're right, sir. 
I hope you're right.
I hope you've all made a KILLING on this action! (laughs)
I hope.
I hope. More to kill.
I just can't hit him!
I just can't!
I just couldn't stop him. 
I just don't want any trouble. 
I just have to aim better.
I just heard from the captain. They're coming.
I just hope he didn't do it for nothing.
I just keep failing, Master! 
I just know I'm next. 
I just need a second.
I just need to focus.
I just never thought I'd be going back there.
I just received an encrypted transmission.
I just saw him...
I just want to ask you all to please light a candle or something.
I just wanted to see what would happen. Like you and the cutter on Kashyyyk.
I just, I never met any Jedi.
I just... I can't hit him. 
I just... I don't know how to repay you.
I keep losing him. 
I killed it?
I knew I could handle it.
I knew I could win. 
I knew I shoulda joined the Brood.
I knew I'd win.
I knew a little. Many Jedi weren't even aware of their existence, but being Cordova's apprentice came with some unique insight.
I knew he couldn't take it.
I knew he would run!
I knew it would end like this!
I knew this was a bad idea. 
I knew you wanted a fight!
I knew you were gonna do that.
I knew you were weak. 
I knew you wouldn't escape!
I knew you'd come back for this.
I knew you'd jump in there.
I know I'll get you.
I know I've got this.
I know a great castle on Takodana that makes the best Bloody Rancors in the galaxy.
I know but I need to be careful.
I know getting this holo-thingy and rebuilding the Jedi Order is important,
I know he's around here!
I know he's around here. 
I know it.
I know the choices that I made took all your choices away.
I know the darkness that is eating you up inside and every day we choose to either feed it...
I know the risk that you took for me.
I know we've had few bumps and bruises. I mean...
I know what it is.
I know what it's like to lose everything.
I know what you are doing.
I know what you can do, I'm not denying that.
I know what's out there, you don't. I've faced them. I can do this. I'll find the holocron. 
I know where she's taking it.
I know you are below us. 
I know you are down there.
I know you are up there. 
I know you are, Cal.
I know you are, Cal. One of the many reasons BD-1 trusted you with Cordova's information. We're lucky to have you.
I know you don't trust me...
I know you said it could... be overwhelming.
I know you took my good spoon.
I know you're about to get that holo... cron.
I know you're around here!
I know you're around here. 
I know you're around here...
I know you're down there!
I know you're down there.
I know you're down there. 
I know you're not. I didn't say that. 
I know you're putting yourself and the Mantis at risk.
I know you're up there!
I know you're up there.
I know you're up there. 
I know! I know.
I know, I know. But it's what I need. Do you think all this life and death stuff isn't stressful?
I know. But I can't abandon my mission.
I know. I feel it too.
I know. I know. My great-grandma would kill me if she knew about the mess I got myself into.
I know. I'm glad I have you two to back me up.
I know. Just be careful. This might be unlike anything you two have faced before.
I lead the remnants of my people into the great unknown, hoping that we will finally find peace.
I like a challenge.
I like how you think.
I like it.
I like that. Bring all of the Jedi out of hiding and let them face us. I dare them to show courage. 
I like what you did with the branches.
I like your confidence. A journey like this one can challenge you in ways you've never been before. 
I like your enthusiasm. But  Dathomir demands more than wit or will.
I like your optimism. I'm glad someone thinks this will all be through someday.
I like your optimism. We could all use a little of that now and then.
I live for the chase.
I lived on a ship like this for years. It became my home. 
I look forward to giving Cere your head.
I look forward to it.
I looked her eye to eye.
I lose control.
I lost a lot of my Partisans. We lose even when we win.
I lost him again. 
I lost him up there. 
I love a moving target. 
I love risking our lives for nothing. It's fantastic.
I love you too.
I love you.
I lucked out.
I made a mistake... and I almost got you killed.
I made a spoon. I wanted to find a way to chip in... save some credits.
I made the wrong choice and I put you in danger. That's no way to guide you.
I make some really good chow, I'm on my ship... 
I may be a gambler but that's a risk I'm not willing to take just yet.
I may have four arms, but if you haven't noticed, I'm basically bite size for most deadly creatures.
I may have training that you don't, but that doesn't mean I have nothing to learn from you. And I do, all the time.
I may not run as fast as I normally should. That's all. 
I may not understand Saw's goals, but he did lay a blow to the Empire here. They slowed down operations. 
I may not understand the whole Force thing, but if you go from cantina to cantina like I do, you'll hear the stories.
I mean - I could show you how.
I mean it.
I mean this heap's been here, what, four years?
I mean, I figure it's some kind of Jedi thing.
I mean, a Jedi was there.
I mean, she got me to follow you to the scariest place in the galaxy, so...
I mean, we all make mistakes. Right? (laughs)
I mean... Sure that may be part of it. But I'm used to it.
I might be one of the last of my kind.
I might fall!
I might have been smaller but the trees were like giants.
I might need to take a break...
I missed him!
I missed more than that, kid. But, still alive and I still got my ship. Got to be grateful about that. 
I missed the target.
I missed!
I missed. Entirely.
I missed...
I missed?
I must be cautious...
I must become quicker. 
I must break free.
I must defeat him!
I must kill this outsider.
I must leave the holocron behind - if anything happens to me, I trust that another will come to find it. 
I must make my Brothers proud. 
I must protect our home. 
I must tell the Brothers. 
I must try harder. 
I need a break...
I need a challenge!
I need a less dangerous assignment. 
I need a minute!
I need a moment to myself.
I need a moment. 
I need a second!
I need a second.
I need a stim, BD!
I need a stim.
I need assistance!
I need cover and time. 
I need cover!
I need help!
I need help, bud!
I need more!
I need one!
I need some cover!
I need some help!
I need some meds, BD-1.
I need some more time to research this sap.
I need some time!
I need some time.
I need some time. Cover me. 
I need something buddy!
I need something for these wounds.
I need something to reach that.
I need stim, buddy.
I need time to focus. We all do.
I need time to myself right now, Cal. 
I need time!
I need to access this. 
I need to be more alert. 
I need to check on your state of mind now and then because if you go...then I go, in a much more painful way.
I need to continue monitoring communications. You should get some rest, Cal.
I need to do this.
I need to get back to the window so I can let the light in.
I need to inform the other squads.
I need to know something.
I need to let command know.
I need to put these out, now!
I need to reload!
I need to reload.
I need to take a breather.
I need to take some leave...
I need to use this. 
I need two workers to climb up and secure the cables.
I need your help.
I needed that. 
I needed this tomb raised.
I never asked you to guide me.
I never came here, I never wanted to. As I recall, that was about the time the two of us began going our separate ways.
I never doubted you.
I never knew much about Dathomir.
I never knew much about holocrons - only the ones they used in school.
I never liked Coruscant.
I noticed it earlier, this feeling in the pit of my stomach. At first I thought it was Greez's cooking.
I noticed something while examining this sarcophagus.
I noticed.
I offer this record of our civilization to those who will follow.
I once faced the winged demon...
I only assume he chose BD-1 because he needed some sort of ability to store encrypted information.
I only knew that Cordova was obsessed with the Zeffo. Believing their teachings to be important.
I overheard some of Saw's men talking. Said you ran into an Imperial guard unlike anything they've seen.
I overloaded the ships reactors.
I owe you one.
I pulled a snap one-eighty during the take off. We found a shortcut through a cave,
I put the chances at zero.
I put us at risk, I get that. I'm owning up to it, but I'm not the only one with problems to deal with. 
I racked up 100% accuracy at target practice earlier.
I ran into a Nightsister.
I rarely lose a hunt.
I really hope that kid pulls through...
I really need a stim!
I really need cover!
I really needed that help. Thank you.
I really needed that.
I recognize that stance.
I refuse to waste my time. 
I regret to report that both our Jedi Order and the Republic have fallen...
I remember being enthralled by what secrets it might hold. Master Yoda taught me how to open it.
I remember this room. Master Yoda melted that door to let us into the caves.
I remember you from the prison.
I remember.
I rerouted communication the moment you tried to contact her.
I resisted.
I respect that. I understand completely.
I saw a lot of fascinating places, met some ridiculous people...
I saw him go down there. 
I saw him go up there. 
I saw him.
I saw movement.
I saw my opportunity and I took it.
I saw something move.
I saw that coming.
I saw the day he died. I saw what I did.
I saw the fall of the Jedi, the overwhelming power of the dark side spreading across the galaxy!
I saw what happened.
I saw what you've been through.
I saw you hide up there. 
I saw you in target practice last night. You were a disgrace!
I saw you, Jedi. 
I second that.
I see 'em. 
I see an easy kill!
I see an enemy down there!
I see an enemy. 
I see an intruder. 
I see him below.
I see it! There's a sphere powering that lantern.
I see it.
I see it. Looks damaged.
I see movement below us!
I see movement. 
I see my sisters. Everything we've lost.
I see no more ranged support present.
I see our mark up high. 
I see someone below?
I see someone. 
I see someone...
I see something. 
I see that. 
I see the Jedi. Down there. 
I see you Jedi. 
I see you down there!
I see you down there, Jedi!
I see you down there.
I see you down there. 
I see you feel no urgency in completing your task. 
I see you met the resident Nightsister but, uh...
I see you there!
I see you there. 
I see you trying to escape down there. 
I see you up there!
I see you up there, intruder. 
I see you up there. 
I see you weathered the storm. 
I see you!
I see you, Jedi.
I see you, Jedi. 
I see you, outsider!
I see you, scum!
I see you, trespasser. 
I see you.
I see your skills are growing.
I see.
I see. I am glad too, BD-1.
I see. Is it working?
I sense something over here.
I shall not fall to you. 
I shall not lose you.
I shall teach them the ways of the Force.
I should be more careful...
I should get patched up.
I should have known. You're always ready.
I should help them.
I should move back.
I should report in.
I should take a break.
I should tend to these wounds.
I shouldn't be.
I slay them easily.
I slew the Jedi!
I smell nydaks.
I spy a Jedi.
I stay far away from them.
I still don't get what you're getting at.
I still play but, it's a little different when we're on the run.
I struck the Jedi!
I study many things.
I suppose he did...he trusted I'd believe him and finish what he started.
I survived, but...
I survived. 
I suspect Cordova left behind a test not just anyone could solve... May the Force be with you.
I suspect an intruder. 
I suspect he went down from here.
I swore to myself that I would die before I would talk.
I take my steak rare.
I taught you everything you know.
I think 20.
I think Greez is going to like this one. Let's just hope it doesn't get too tall.
I think I can catch him!
I think I can do this.
I think I hear someone.
I think I heard something.
I think I lost him. 
I think I saw a jotaz near here.
I think I saw something.
I think I see you down there. 
I think I see...
I think I will like my time aboard the Mantis.
I think I'm done.
I think I'm gonna be sick...
I think I'm near the turbolift.
I think I'm standing in one.
I think he escaped again. 
I think he took out our last rocket trooper? I can't really see. 
I think he took out our rocket backup!
I think he went down there. 
I think he's below us. 
I think he's below...
I think he's calling it quits. 
I think he's down there. 
I think he's down there?
I think he's giving up. 
I think he's gone.
I think he's gone?
I think he's scared of us!
I think he's scared!
I think he's shakin'!
I think he's still up there. 
I think he's trying to run. 
I think he's up there. 
I think it's Merrin's turn to enjoy his... charm.
I think it's kind of nice. You're important, and not just to those plants. You've helped keep us alive.
I think it's my business.
I think it's sealed.
I think it's time someone came forward.
I think not.
I think so.
I think someone else is more qualified to search here.
I think someone's here.
I think someone's here. 
I think that was our last flametrooper. 
I think that was our last gunner! I couldn't stop him!
I think that was our last gunner. 
I think that's a slyyyg?
I think that's all of them.
I think that's enough intel for one day. 
I think that's it.
I think that's our droid support down!
I think there was a Jedi and their Padawan on board.
I think this lifestyle suits you.
I think this might be a lift to the lower floor.
I think this ship's leaking something. Smell's like something died.
I think we got lucky.
I think we lost him.
I think we'll be fine.
I think we're getting close.
I think we're in the clear...
I think we're in trouble, BD.
I think we're safe for now.
I think we're too much for him. 
I think we've got him. 
I think were out of danger.
I think what we're doing is a little more important than simply exploring the galaxy. 
I think you can handle this, BD. 
I think you know what to do. 
I think you should just give up.
I think... Yeah that was our last flametrooper.
I thought Greez jeopardized this mission with his reckless gambling, but here I've made the same mistakes... 
I thought I saw him.
I thought Jedi were tougher!
I thought Project Auger got cancelled. Why start it again?
I thought so at the time. But now I'm thinking Cordova knew something more...
I thought the Jedi were their targets?
I thought the same thing once.
I thought there was going to be a real fight.
I thought we had a victory here... right now, it doesn't look like it.
I thought when we were older, we would be together.
I thought you hated nature.
I thought you said the Empire doesn't know this place exists. 
I thought you were supposed to be a Jedi Knight? 
I thought you'd put up more of a fight!
I tire of these games.
I tire of these games. 
I tire of this, Jedi. 
I told the Grand Inquisitor you wouldn't be stupid enough to show your face here again.
I told you to replace the stabilizer!
I took him out. 
I tried to lure them away from my Padawan, Trilla.
I tried to, but I lost count. 
I tried! But I think it hates me...
I trust her.
I trust her. She has a plan. Order from the Emperor. 
I trust in the Empire. I trust in the Emperor. That is all I need to know about my orders. 
I trust the might of our brothers. 
I trust you. Let's do it.
I understand our orders. My aim is consistently sharp and accurate.
I understand.
I understand. 
I understand. I think I'm ready.
I understand. I'm here to support you if you need me.
I understand. I've got intel that may help you.
I understand. Let's keep moving.
I understand. The fastest way back to your ship is on this tramline.
I understand. You can count on me if the Brood comes after you again.
I used to be a topographer, traveled to rural planets mapping their natural formations. 
I used to live there before the Empire came. Do you know it?
I used to sit on Bracca dreaming about storming Coruscant with survivors from the Jedi Council.
I used your rifle. I thought I was a goner before you showed up.
I usually am. Now get goin', kid.
I wagered one meaningless padawan against a prize that will win me the Emperor's favor.
I want more!
I want to go home!
I want to restore the Order.
I was a wreck.
I was alone for a... a long time.
I was arrogant, I was foolish.
I was discovered by a Seeker when I was very young. They took me to the Temple to train.
I was forced to strike them down and I escaped.
I was getting there...
I was looking for the Jedi.
I was once a Jedi.
I was only a child when they attacked.
I was raised to reject the rest of the galaxy. Outsiders were dangerous.
I was scared that they'd find out who I was or...
I was so good though. You shoulda seen me!
I was stationed here some time ago. Many Jedi were dealt with in this very spot.
I was taught that we always have a choice in how we respond to misfortune.
I was trained by following strict protocols. Prepared for everything... or so I thought.
I was wrong to think you could stand with me.
I wasn't alone. I had uhh... people.
I wasn't aware Lateron had an academy.
I wasn't sure at first. 
I will avenge my Brothers.
I will avenge them all!
I will avenge them!
I will blast you!
I will bleed you dry!
I will break free of this. 
I will break you once I'm free. 
I will break you. 
I will catch you!
I will chase you across the galaxy if I have to!
I will create a distraction and meet you. If I am not there when you arrive, depart without me.
I will defeat you!
I will defeat you.
I will defeat you. 
I will destroy him before he even sees me. 
I will destroy you!
I will destroy you.
I will destroy you. 
I will end you!
I will face you again. 
I will find you on Bracca.
I will find you!
I will find you.
I will find you. 
I will get through. 
I will gut you!
I will have you, Jedi!
I will help you find this Astrium.
I will honor your teaching.
I will hunt you down!
I will hunt you down...
I will investigate. 
I will join you.
I will keep those crawlers away.
I will kill all our enemies. 
I will kill it.
I will kill you!
I will make sure you're eliminated.
I will make you hurt. 
I will make you pay for this. 
I will make you suffer. 
I will monitor Imperial communications here. 
I will never forget.
I will not be denied!
I will not be denied! 
I will not be deterred!
I will not bend. 
I will not fail now. 
I will not fail.
I will not fail. 
I will not fall to you.
I will not fall.
I will not fall. 
I will not lose. 
I will not miss. 
I will not withdraw!
I will prevail.
I will protect the Empire. 
I will put an end to you! Now!
I will remain strong. 
I will seal the blast doors but if any cross your path, do not hesitate.
I will see who intrudes here. 
I will smash through. 
I will so easily destroy this outsider.
I will stay here. I do not need to go any further.  
I will still terminate you. 
I will stop this brutality. 
I will stop you.
I will stop you. Now. 
I will strike true!
I will strike you. 
I will succeed!
I will take your life!
I will, just saying... you better have my back. 
I will. As soon as we get out of here.
I wish I could say your sisters were wrong. I understand they wanted to protect themselves.
I wish I could tell you that you'll move past it, but the truth is you never will.
I wish more people felt that way.
I wish people would see what the Empire is really doing across the galaxy.
I wish to fight by your side.
I won't abandon the Wookiees. I'll take any fighters who want to stay.
I won't back down.
I won't be defeated.
I won't bow to you!
I won't break focus. 
I won't fail you, Brothers.
I won't fail you.
I won't fall to you. 
I won't fall, traitor. 
I won't fall.
I won't falter!
I won't falter.
I won't falter. 
I won't have it!
I won't leave the Wookiees to suffer alone.
I won't let him escape next time.
I won't let him escape.
I won't let up.
I won't let you escape!
I won't let you escape.
I won't let you escape. 
I won't let you flee!
I won't let you kill me.
I won't let you manipulate me.
I won't let you stop me. 
I won't let you strike me down!
I won't let you take those children.
I won't let you touch them.
I won't let you win, traitor.
I won't let you win.
I won't lose you!
I won't lose you. 
I won't lose!
I won't miss again.
I won't miss. 
I won't move.  
I won't run from them anymore.
I won't slip up.
I won't stop.
I won't submit. 
I won't yield, Jedi.
I wonder how big it'll get?
I wonder if the Nightbrothers got him.
I wonder if we can use this magnet again?
I wonder what that is.
I wonder what that is?
I wonder what that was?
I wonder what the scanners picked up earlier?
I wonder what this socket powers?
I wonder...
I would be very careful Cal. You need to be on guard against anyone seeking out the darkness of Dathomir. 
I would dearly love to research this creature further, but the Astrium must be my priority.
I would have survived had you not been so weak.
I would like that.
I would like to learn it.
I would like to learn it. 
I would not cross them.
I would offer you the same thing.
I wouldn't count on him being friendly.
I wouldn't lose my cool like that.
I wouldn't overthink it.
I wouldn't worry about it then.
I wrote it.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the same. Even at a young age, Trilla was very smart.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hoping you'd say that because you know they're gonna need more than fancy magic tricks.
I'd be running to the 'fresher every couple minutes.
I'd be scared of me too.
I'd best most did. They're smart.
I'd bet my bounty you went above.
I'd better report this.
I'd hoped for more.
I'd like that. Yeah.
I'd like to see that again!
I'd like to see you try that again.
I'd love to get some Jedi action.
I'd say Cordova's reason for coming here was extremely important to risk his life, but risks were second nature to him.
I'd say these vines are too creepy for Greez, but...he's Greez.
I'll add it to the plan.
I'll annihilate you.
I'll avenge you, Brother. 
I'll bash him!
I'll be back as fast as I can.
I'll be back before you know it.
I'll be back...
I'll be careful with the ice.
I'll be doing damage to that traitorous filth.
I'll be in touch once I crack this.
I'll be keeping an eye on everything. If you have any leads, let me know.
I'll be listening for Imperial activity.
I'll be more careful. 
I'll be okay. 
I'll be okay. It's better than hiding on Bracca.
I'll be ready for them.
I'll be ready.
I'll be the one to end this. 
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I'll be waiting.
I'll be watching.
I'll blast him. 
I'll bleed you dry. 
I'll bleed you more!
I'll bleed you, coward!
I'll break through!
I'll break through.
I'll break through. 
I'll break you!
I'll break you.
I'll break your guard!
I'll break your guard.
I'll break your guard. 
I'll break your guard. Then you. 
I'll break your resolve!
I'll break your resolve.
I'll bring him down. 
I'll bring you back some Wookiee slaves.
I'll call Sorc.
I'll catch every blow. 
I'll catch him!
I'll catch up in a minute, okay?
I'll catch you soon.
I'll catch you this time. 
I'll catch you!
I'll catch you, Jedi.
I'll catch you.
I'll catch you. 
I'll check above.
I'll check below.
I'll check it out.
I'll check it out. 
I'll complain all I want. This fight is never going to end.
I'll crush anything that moves.
I'll crush you.
I'll cut the defiance out of you. 
I'll defeat you. 
I'll deflect them all. 
I'll destroy you like the others.
I'll destroy you!
I'll do that after shift change.
I'll do the same to you.
I'll do what I can to monitor their movements. 
I'll dodge everything. 
I'll drop him!
I'll drop you!
I'll drop you.
I'll end this quick.
I'll end this quick. 
I'll end this quickly. 
I'll end this!
I'll end you later.
I'll end you!
I'll end you. 
I'll end you...
I'll end your suffering. 
I'll enjoy killing you. 
I'll enjoy watching you die, Jedi!
I'll erase you from existence!
I'll evade every strike. 
I'll expedite this.
I'll fight harder next time.
I'll find a way to help you.
I'll find an opening. 
I'll find him!
I'll find my way there.
I'll find the children. Train them to be Jedi. And overthrow the Empire.
I'll find you Jedi!
I'll find you again.
I'll find you!
I'll find you.
I'll find you. 
I'll find you. Jedi. 
I'll flatten you. 
I'll get a commendation for this!
I'll get after him.
I'll get him.
I'll get him. He'll be back.
I'll get revenge, Brother!
I'll get right on it. 
I'll get right on that, sir.
I'll get through.
I'll get through. 
I'll get us out of here. Just hang on!
I'll get you Jedi. 
I'll get you!
I'll get you! Somehow...
I'll get you.
I'll get you. 
I'll get you. Just wait. 
I'll get you...
I'll give you a show.
I'll go check it out.
I'll go look. 
I'll handle it. 
I'll handle this.
I'll have a Jedi with me.
I'll have revenge!
I'll have to pick up the slack. 
I'll hit my target. Don't you worry. 
I'll hit ya. Just you wait. 
I'll impale you!
I'll investigate.
I'll investigate. 
I'll just jack one.
I'll just keep dodging.
I'll keep a look out for you.
I'll keep him busy.
I'll keep tracking you.
I'll keep watch here.
I'll kill it.
I'll kill you myself!
I'll land the next one.
I'll look into it. 
I'll look into this. 
I'll look this way!
I'll maim you!
I'll make it quick, Jedi. 
I'll make it.
I'll make you pay. 
I'll make you regret that. 
I'll meet you at the clamps.
I'll meet you at your ship.
I'll mop the floor with you.
I'll need fire to burn the vines. Any ideas?
I'll need to find a different way.
I'll never break his guard.
I'll never falter. 
I'll never give it to you.
I'll never let up. 
I'll never stop.
I'll relish bleeding you.
I'll relish killing you.
I'll remember that.
I'll rip their legs off and drain their poison.
I'll search for signs of Cordova in the meantime.
I'll see what I can do...
I'll see you dead, traitor. 
I'll see you die. 
I'll share more of my plan after you reach the Vault.
I'll shoot him!
I'll shoot you through!
I'll show you!
I'll slaughter you!
I'll slice you to ribbons!
I'll smash your face!
I'll still get you.
I'll stop every attack. 
I'll stop you!
I'll stop you.
I'll stop you. 
I'll take a look.
I'll take care of it.
I'll take those odds.
I'll take you down!
I'll take you out myself. 
I'll tell you something... the Mantis knows how to get through any storm, any fight, anything you throw at her.
I'll thrash you.
I'll trade tasks with anyone that wants to check this out.
I'll try to find a way to it.
I'll use my spare for now
I'll watch you bleed.
I'll! Break! Free!
I'll... take him down.
I'm Cal Kestis.
I'm Cal.
I'm a little busy and I think you should be too.
I'm a little busy right now. 
I'm a little busy, Cal. 
I'm afraid I can't do that but... perhaps we could help each other. You see, I...
I'm afraid so. As far as we know, a lot of our history is lost. 
I'm afraid!
I'm after 'em!
I'm after him!
I'm after the Jedi.
I'm after the enemy!
I'm after the intruder. 
I'm alright!  Just pinned down.
I'm always on high alert.
I'm at 14.
I'm aware. Thanks for the advice. Let's keep position.
I'm burning!
I'm burning!!
I'm busy. I gotta figure out what to cook next.
I'm charging up.
I'm checking this out. 
I'm coming for you!
I'm coming out of a Nightbrother village now. Hoping to get back on track.
I'm coming! Don't run!
I'm concerned the situation may be escalating.
I'm concerned you're jumping from one risk to the next.
I'm definitely getting a promotion.
I'm done playing, Jedi. 
I'm done waiting!
I'm done with these games. 
I'm done with this one. 
I'm ending this.
I'm excited to find you.
I'm falling back. 
I'm falling!
I'm faster than you!
I'm faster.
I'm feeling weak, BD.
I'm finally back to where I was before the purge.
I'm fine, Commander. W-where is Marseph? Where is my Padawan?
I'm fine, Greez. 
I'm fine, although she made it clear we're not welcome. She wasn't alone.
I'm fine. Just fine. Very much ready to get off this planet.
I'm finished waiting.
I'm floating...
I'm focused, sir. But when that Jedi turns the corner, he better not underestimate me. I'm ready.
I'm frightened.
I'm fully apprised of the situation there.
I'm gettin' more greys just thinkin about it.
I'm getting a transmission now, probably the squad. Hang on, it's from the Supreme Chancellor!
I'm getting at the fact that I'm the captain on this ship and I deserve respect. 
I'm getting chilly. Anyone else chilly?
I'm getting nothing.
I'm glad I found you, BD.
I'm glad that's over.
I'm glad we could help the Wookiees.
I'm glad we found you, Cal. Good luck in there. And remember: think before you react.
I'm glad you have stims.
I'm glad you're always so excited.
I'm glad you're here, BD.
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm glad you're with us. 
I'm glad you're with us. We need more than just help at this point, we need those who believe in what we're doing.
I'm going to beat you!
I'm going to beat you, Jedi.
I'm going to beat you. 
I'm going to bleed you dry. 
I'm going to break you. 
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to draw this out. 
I'm going to end you!
I'm going to end you.
I'm going to end you. 
I'm going to enjoy bleeding you. 
I'm going to enjoy ending you.
I'm going to enjoy killing you.
I'm going to enjoy this.
I'm going to enjoy this. 
I'm going to enjoy this...
I'm going to find the issue, and I'm going to take care of it.
I'm going to get you!
I'm going to get you. 
I'm going to go look. 
I'm going to investigate. 
I'm going to kill you, outsider!
I'm going to make an example out of him.
I'm going to stop you. 
I'm going to stop you. Now.
I'm gonna check it out. 
I'm gonna check that out. 
I'm gonna demolish you!
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna end this.
I'm gonna enjoy this. 
I'm gonna find my opening. 
I'm gonna get court-martialed for this.
I'm gonna get him.
I'm gonna get my credits.
I'm gonna make you bleed. 
I'm gonna shoot him!
I'm gonna stop you. 
I'm gonna take a look around, okay?
I'm gonna take a look. 
I'm gonna take you out. 
I'm gonna try. You two still have this mission and I've got to do more than keep screwing it up.
I'm great. Just enjoying some peace and quiet.
I'm handling it. 
I'm happy for you.
I'm happy to see you too.
I'm heading over there. 
I'm here for you if you need me.
I'm here, Cal.
I'm hit!
I'm hit. 
I'm honored, but...
I'm hungry. It's reducing the quality of my posture and aim.
I'm hurt... but we won...
I'm in bad shape, buddy.
I'm in the tomb. It's massive.
I'm just checking it out. 
I'm just focusing on the mission.
I'm just sayin'... Cere and I spent a long time searching for you, kid.
I'm just saying, I'm not too bad of a-
I'm just saying, he wasn't that friendly with me when I first met him. I think you've got yourself a new friend.
I'm just saying, it's not my fault if I miss a target.
I'm just surprised to see him outside on Dathomir.
I'm just taking some time to myself. Thanks, Cal.
I'm just telling this one about the time I risked my neck for my old crew. 
I'm just too fast!
I'm killing it.
I'm kind of hoping we see some action.
I'm kind of the same way. Back on Bracca, I couldn't wait to do something for the Jedi.
I'm listening.
I'm locked out. 
I'm lookin'.
I'm looking for someone.
I'm looking into it. 
I'm lucky to stand with you, stormtrooper.
I'm more concerned about the Second Sister than the troopers.
I'm more powerful than you'll ever be.
I'm moving out. 
I'm never going to get promoted...
I'm not Ready.
I'm not Trilla. I'll be fine. 
I'm not afraid of their poison.
I'm not afraid.
I'm not asking you to say anything. It's okay, Cere. Really.
I'm not chasing you! Nope!
I'm not doing all the work...
I'm not done with you!
I'm not getting anything.
I'm not going out like this!
I'm not gonna let that happen here.
I'm not here for fun. I'm here to get the job done. That's what matters, stormtrooper.
I'm not in it for the memories and honestly...
I'm not interested in power.
I'm not leaving you.
I'm not like you two, I don't meditate or do Jedi stuff, I just push through and hope not to die.
I'm not losing focus, Jedi. 
I'm not playing, Jedi. 
I'm not ready to give up yet.
I'm not saying, Do it for me, but you two are the best thing that ever happened in my life.
I'm not seeing things so, yes?
I'm not so easily defeated. 
I'm not so sure...
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
I'm not sure I'm ready.
I'm not sure what caused the crash. But I know there was a Jedi and Padawan on board.
I'm not sure what that is.
I'm not sure what that was.
I'm not sure, but I'm trying.
I'm not sure. I don't know if I like it. Silence is strange when you aren't looking for it.
I'm not sure. I... think there's something wrong with my helmet.
I'm not sure. It's something I'm used to, I guess. During the Clone Wars, every battle was risky.
I'm not sure. Just be ready. 
I'm not taking the blame if there's a breach over here.
I'm not worried.
I'm not. That's why adaptation is important.
I'm okay.
I'm on a mission from Master Eno Cordova.
I'm on fire!
I'm on fire! Assist!
I'm on fire!!
I'm on him!
I'm on him. 
I'm on it!
I'm on it.
I'm on it. 
I'm on the hunt. 
I'm on the target. 
I'm on you!
I'm on you. 
I'm only joking, Cal. Don't focus on the opinions of others, it is a weakness your enemies can exploit.
I'm only kidding. I'm still terrified of her. 
I'm opening the path to the holocron.
I'm persistent.
I'm picking up on something.
I'm playing it safe, keeping the space witch happy.
I'm prepared to face anything.
I'm prepared.
I'm pretty hurt.
I'm pretty sure we had worse on Kashyyyk.
I'm ready for whatever awaits.
I'm ready to kill every Jedi I can find.
I'm ready to leave anytime, Cal.
I'm ready.
I'm ready. I know what to do. 
I'm ready. Let's try it!
I'm really sorry. I'll try to avoid them if I can.
I'm rerouting any direct paths to you but it won't hold them for long. Get to the maintenance halls, Cal.
I'm responsible for the path that Trilla is on.
I'm rich!
I'm right behind you!
I'm right behind you.
I'm right here. 
I'm rooting for you.
I'm safe, unlike too many of the others. Choyyssyk and I are with Tarfful.
I'm safe, unlike too many of the others. Did Mirienna give you our rendezvous coordinates?
I'm scared!
I'm scared.
I'm searching for, uh, a Jedi. I think...
I'm sending you coordinates to rendezvous with us.
I'm slipping!
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm so ready for this. 
I'm so sorry.
I'm so tired of chasing you...
I'm sorry I couldn't be here sooner, but I haven't given up on Kashyyyk.
I'm sorry about your scomp link.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that. Nothing is perfect.
I'm sorry we had to come back here.
I'm sorry, Greez.
I'm sorry, Master!
I'm sorry, Master.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
I'm spotting something.
I'm standing next to two crashed ships. Looks like you weren't the only pilot who had trouble with the wind here.
I'm stayin' on you. 
I'm staying put on the Mantis once we arrive. Red sunlight cannot be good for your skin.
I'm stepping back.
I'm stepping back. 
I'm still standing, aren't I? Still got it.
I'm stronger now because of the pain.
I'm stuck!
I'm stuck! Help!
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. 
I'm sure I'll be blamed for this.
I'm sure everything's under control.
I'm sure it's going to be a big help.
I'm sure it's under control.
I'm sure she has some skills that could make us very rich.
I'm sure they'll pull through.
I'm sure this so-called Jedi had a reason he went to Zeffo.
I'm sure we'll beat you.
I'm sure you can handle it.
I'm surprised Cordova went there. He must have had good reason.
I'm surprised she didn't tell you. Cere was never good at keeping secrets.
I'm surprised you made it past the guards.
I'm takin' you down!
I'm taking a break. 
I'm taking point on this pursuit.
I'm taking this hilt with us.
I'm taking you down.
I'm taking you down. 
I'm taking you in. 
I'm taking you out. 
I'm telling you, it's a clue. There's a stowaway on this ship and I'm gonna prove it!
I'm the better fighter.
I'm the boss of this operation.
I'm the superior fighter.
I'm too fast for you. 
I'm too quick for you.
I'm tracking him down!
I'm tracking him. 
I'm trapped!
I'm trapped. 
I'm trash, just not approved trash.
I'm tripped!
I'm waiting.
I'm watching you.
I'm watching you. 
I'm winning this. 
I'm workin' as fast as I can!
I'm worried about what we will find.
I'm wounded. 
I'm... I'm fine. Phew! I'm fine.
I'm... I'm gonna need a second. 
I'm... injured!
I'm... sensing something weird.
I'm... sure they have a good reason...
I'm... trapped somehow. 
I've also been finding pieces of hair all over the place. Small and wiry.
I've always liked it. When I was younger, I used to pour through every piece I could find at the Jedi Archives.
I've always said they couldn't all be traitors.
I've always wanted to learn an instrument. Think you could teach me...after all this is settled?
I've basically taken this ship apart and put it back together again. 
I've been hit.
I've been hurt!
I've been in this room before, on the outside.
I've been keeping count of traitors whom I've eliminated. 
I've been monitoring Imperial communications and I picked up something...
I've been on guard all day, my aim may not be perfect.
I've been through some stuff in my time, but I've never faced death more than with you two on this trip.
I've been through struggles like this before. Well, not exactly like this. I mean, no...
I've been to many different planets in the Galaxy searching for...well, you.
I've been to strange places before, but this one is old.
I've been training.
I've been training. 
I've been waiting for this. 
I've carried so much hate for you.
I've caught the enemy. 
I've caught you, outsider. 
I've caught you, traitor.
I've cornered the fugitive!
I've disabled the shields on the outer sections of the Fortress.
I've found my next victim. 
I've found repeated glyphs with the same word: Astrium. Always near damaged statues.
I've found similar relics across Bogano's surface, including a precious few with glyphs!
I've found you. 
I've got 'em.
I've got a contact under us!
I've got a mykal here.
I've got a read on the Wookiee general's position.
I've got a scazz.
I've got a shot!
I've got a wyyyschokk here.
I've got an opening!
I've got eyes on him!
I've got him!
I've got him! Up there!
I've got him.
I've got him. 
I've got it. 
I've got more for you!
I've got movement above us!
I've got nothin' but respect for that man, but this isn't a forest skirmish.
I've got nothing.
I've got our mark. 
I've got our target. 
I've got out target. 
I've got this beast.
I've got this covered.
I've got this!
I've got this, Brother. 
I've got this.
I've got this. I've got this. 
I've got time.
I've got visual contact down there!
I've got ya!
I've got you now!
I've got you now.
I've got you now. 
I've got you!
I've got you, Jedi. 
I've got you.
I've got you. 
I've grabbed you.
I've had more action with target practice.
I've had much worse. 
I've had worse. 
I've have experienced many tests that compare to yours. I am in one as we speak.
I've haven't heard that before.
I've heard Jedi can kill you with a thought. 
I've heard of ancient cultures, but don't know much about them.
I've heard stories of what Jedi can do. Reinforcements are too far away to get here in time.
I've heard the stories: witches, living dead... Don't you have a job to do? C'mon, already.
I've heard.
I've hidden a holocron detailing the names and locations of all known young Force-sensitives deep within the Vault.
I've informed the Council, to... lukewarm reception.
I've learned my lesson.
I've learned not to doubt you. 
I've located the holocron. Sending you the location now.
I've lost him. 
I've lost my patience! 
I've lost visual contact. 
I've needed a fight. 
I've never heard of anything like that.
I've never seen anything like that. 
I've never seen you do anything like that before.
I've often thought the same thing.
I've reached 100% accuracy with my blade. You?
I've reconnected with the Force but... I still feel blocked.
I've sealed the cargo door!
I've seen some stuff in my days, and lemme tell you: I do not need to see a Nightsister.
I've seen that before.
I've seen what comes from their dead.
I've shot a couple dozen scazz myself.
I've sliced through their encryption. I'm scrambling transmissions, but it won't be long before they're restored. 
I've spent years...
I've stumbled.
I've suffered far worse.
I've survived worse.
I've taken the artifact back to my ship for analysis. Pity you couldn't make it in time.
I've taken worse. 
I've uncovered Kujet's legacy:
I, too, was intrigued by the mysteries of our galaxy.
I, uh...
I-I can't get it.
I-I missed...
I-I think he's injured.
I-I was thinking of whipping up some scazz steaks.
I-I've been working on this heap a long time.
I-it's coming!
I-it's the Jedi!
I. Hate. This. Planet.
I. Never. Miss.
I... I can take you. 
I... I can't get free!
I... I can't hit him!
I... I can't reach!
I... I can't!
I... I can't...!
I... I cannot control them.
I... I didn't mean to!
I... I got him!
I... I got it?
I... I hear you. 
I... I hit him!
I... I just can't reach him.
I... I killed a Jedi!
I... I killed it?
I... I lost our target...
I... I made it.
I... I missed!
I... I missed.
I... I must tell the others!
I... I see you!
I... I slipped!
I... I think I won?
I... I think it's gone.
I... I think we won.
I... I think we're done.
I... I'm firing. 
I... I'm on him!
I... I've got him!
I... can't do that again...
I... can't push it. 
I... can't tell if you're kidding.
I... can't... move...
I... cannot give up. 
I... cannot move.
I... missed.
I... will break through. 
I... will get you. 
I... will not fall. 
I...I can't get him!
I..I can't...
ISB never shares their intel.
Ice and cold has never stopped us before.
Identify that patter.
Identify yourself!
Identify yourself.
Identify yourself. 
Identifying an attacker.
Idiotic beast!
Idiotic creature!
If I don't hear the words: We're ready to leave. then get outta here.
If I find that traitor, I'll show him pain.
If I give up on myself, then I give up on them. I'm sure you have a few of those.
If I hadn't, it would have killed me!
If I move this lift, it passes the panel.
If I shared our secrets with him in return.
If I spot the Jedi, you'll know... and so will he. 
If a Jedi can get away from an Inquisitor, we're all in danger.
If anything goes wrong with this plan we're finished.
If anything, I'm happy I left. I wouldn't have experienced this place if I'd stayed.
If he comes back - we'll finish him. 
If he gets away, Command will kill us!
If he keeps recovering it's all over... 
If he survived this long, he must have some skill... or help. 
If it comes around, don't you dare think of running again.
If it wasn't for her.
If it were up to me, all outsiders would suffer. 
If something is over here, I'll handle it
If that Bounty Hunter sees us they'll report back to Sorc Tormo.
If that droid gets my ship greasy I'll be very upset. I won't kick him outside but I'll be upset. 
If that's where the path leads. Fingers crossed, huh?
If the Empire continues to control the galaxy, I expect many other people like Saw to fight for freedom. 
If the Jedi makes it this far, it is our duty to eliminate him.
If the Zeffo had contact with Kashyyyk...
If the fugitive comes this way I'm ready for him.
If the rumors are even true.
If the spheres hold energy, they might be used to power something.
If there are no Jedi left, then what's the point?
If there is something we missed here, let's find it.
If there were any signs I missed.
If they don't make it... do you think you could bring them back?
If they get here before you do...
If they open the holocron this is where those kids will end up.
If they were following the Mantis we would've been swarmed already.
If they're worn out we'll need to request new ones.
If things keep going so well with Project Auger, we might finally get a promotion!
If we can do it quick.
If we don't find a way to control them soon, our village may be at risk.
If we drop the lantern, I bet it would break open.
If we encounter any flame beetles out here, don't run this time.
If we encounter the Jedi, be smart. He may do things we've never seen before.
If we lose it's because he took out our heavy artillery. 
If we saw action all day, I could do this all day. 
If you are unwilling to do so, stormtrooper, speak now.
If you ask me, Cal, I know you can.
If you cannot surpass my teaching then you will die here!
If you don't believe in your own training then you are already dead, stormtrooper.
If you don't get the prisoners soon...
If you ever come across a Jedi, you may think differently. 
If you fall, I promise to avenge your death and kill every last Jedi I can find.
If you find him, destroy him. 
If you get an attack off first, you better strike dead or I will.
If you get arrogant, you die. Just be ready.
If you get in my way, I'll take you out too. The Jedi is mine.
If you hate it so much just shoot it.
If you haven't noticed, I don't really have a lot left, but I still got pride. I've always believed in my pride.
If you must know, I made a few... unfortunately choices.
If you say so.
If you say so. 
If you see a deadly dangerous monster, kill it before it kills me, will ya?
If you see crawlers, strike quickly.
If you see the outsider, kill him.
If you take them from their homes to train as Jedi... Won't they be hunted like you?
If you want to go home, I can take the traitor out myself. 
If you weren't such a good pilot, I'd hand you over myself.
If you'd been training you'd be able to hit anything charging at you. 
If you're not ready to leave, don't bother me.
If you're telling the truth...
Ignore him! Advance!
Ignoring enemy commands.
Ilum isn't a very welcoming planet, but it's a sacred place for Jedi. We find the crystals that power our lightsabers here.
Ilum was our planet, Cal. Don't let them forget that.
Ilum? We're gonna freeze solid!
Imagine the artifacts the Empire would've missed if it weren't for your intervention on this backwater planet.
Immobilize him.
Immobilizing enemy.
Impact!
Imperial patrol was about to discover our location so...
Imperial sap refinery lies dead ahead.
Imperial troopers must have combed this area clean. 
Impossible!
Impossible.
Impossible. You try that, a Mandalorian would break you in two.
Impossible?!
Impractical. 
Impressive reflexes.
Impressive view.
Impressive, Jedi. 
Impressive.
Impressive...
In Dathomir.
In a moment of weakness I used the dark side of the Force. I'm not sure I wouldn't do it again.
In a sense.
In accordance with the Emperor's will, we've occupied Zeffo, redistributing its inhabitants.
In here!
In hiding, I was useless, but now... Now we're both chipping in.
In hiding, I was...
In my sights. 
In our own ways, we did.
In pain? 
In pursuit of the target. 
In pursuit!
In pursuit.
In pursuit. 
In retreat.
In the Force.
In the end they were nearly wiped out in a massacre.
In the end, we always helped each other through it, somehow.  
In the flesh.
In the meantime...
In the middle of war, it's hard to remember those things actually exist...but they do.
In the name of the Emperor: kill!
In this droid you will find everything you need to succeed on this journey.

Innocents. Force-sensitive children who'll be hunted down and murdered.
Inquisitors were dispatched to the Bracca system.
Inquisitors?
Inside is a list of Force-sensitive children across the galaxy, but the Empire is looking for it too.
Inside of it is something called the Astrium.
Instead, I closed her eyes and bundled her with the others.
Instead, the Order's hopes rest on a gambler, a fallen Jedi, and a failed Padawan.
Insufficient power.
Insurgent above us. 
Insurgent activity is increasing on Kashyyyk.
Insurgent below us. 
Insurgent! 
Insurgent, straight ahead.
Insurgents are rarely alone. Eyes out. 
Insurgents everywhere! 
Integrity compromised.
Intel reports a Jedi had been hiding there for some time.
Intel suggests that some of the captives there are guerrilla fighters.
Intel was right.
Intelligence has nothing to do with it. It's all strength and power.
Interesting.

Is a most powerful ally.
Is anyone here?
Is anyone really ready? Look, I may look like a risk-taker, but to tell you the truth, I'm a big old soup full of doubt.
Is anyone there?
Is dodging all you're good at?
Is every place we're gonna go as terrible as this?
Is footwork all you have?
Is gone for now but she's still chasing us.
Is he - ?
Is he down there?
Is he going to get away?
Is he gonna kill us all?
Is he still up there?
Is he trying to escape?
Is he up there?
Is he using stims?
Is he with you?
Is he... below us?
Is it dead?
Is it getting back up?
Is it how you imagined? The rest of the galaxy, I mean.
Is it just me?
Is it over?
Is it really dead?
Is it true?
Is it true?!
Is running all you do?
Is she... an Inquisitor?!? Incredible. What do we do now?
Is someone back there?
Is someone making noise?
Is someone moving there?
Is someone over there?
Is someone there?
Is somethin' there?
Is that a complaint, stormtrooper? These caves are key to our operation.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Is that a lightsaber?!
Is that a power cable?
Is that a saying?
Is that a scazz?
Is that a trash chute?
Is that a wyyyschokk?
Is that all you have?
Is that all you're capable of?
Is that all you've got?
Is that all? I expected more.
Is that an intruder?
Is that even possible?
Is that even possible? 
Is that him? Tell him he better get his bu-
Is that how you do it?
Is that really the worst of your problems? 
Is that so?
Is that some kind of trick?
Is that supposed to uplift me?
Is that thing dead?
Is that who leads the Inquisitors?
Is that who you want beside you when you find the holocron?
Is that why you're hiding in the Mantis?
Is that?!
Is the Empire going to find us?
Is there a difference?
Is there someone specific you're thinking of?
Is there someone there?
Is this Zeffo?
Is this all of them?
Is this all you have?
Is this it for the Jedi?
Is this some kind of trick?
Is this what passes for a Jedi now?
Is your fear so great?
Is... Is anyone back there?
Is... is that something flying this way?
Isn't Jaro waiting?
Isn't that proof it's dangerous? I mean, c'mon, if they're worried about it.
Isolated.
It ain't easy to avoid detection when the Empire's hunting you down.
It ain't easy to get back up and you're doing it, Cal. Keep it up.
It ain't you I'm worried about.
It almost took me.
It always works out... somehow.
It appears many, yet not all the Zeffo could wield the Force!
It appears that was our last droid. 
It appears the Zeffo had some interest...
It belonged to a Jedi, fleeing from the Empire with her Padawan. There weren't any survivors.
It brings me no joy to see my sisters this way, but I cannot control them or put them to rest.
It brings me no joy to see them like this, but I have no way to stop them.
It burned to the touch.
It burns!
It burns! 
It can only be a wroshyr tree from Kashyyyk.
It can't be over yet.
It can't be over.
It can't mean anything good.
It connects us.
It connects you.
It contains a list of Force-sensitive children.
It didn't work!
It does kinda feel that way.
It feels safe. I get why these zaur like it.
It feels... different than the other tomb.
It fits! Thank you, BD!
It happens.
It has to be kept out of the hands of the Empire.
It hurts! Help!
It is a necessary part of the path.
It is more secluded than even I would've thought. It seems the way in was secret even during the time of the Zeffo.
It is my recommendation that we disband the project and leave a token outpost to keep scavengers from stealing our technology.
It is not built for close support.
It is real.
It is so vast. I see now my life on Dathomir was...limited.
It is the key and the guide: the Zeffo Astrium!
It is time for instruction.
It is time you get what you deserve - death. 
It is up to us if he isn't. 
It isn't murder if you're doing the galaxy a favor.
It isn't.
It just vanished.
It just won't open.
It just won't stop!
It leaves a foul burn.
It may seem impossible, but with persistence and the Force as your ally, you will overcome any obstacle.
It means I'll be joining you.
It must like the soil.
It once served as a proving ground for Force-sensitive Zeffo sages,
It opens a Vault on a distant planet.
It reminds me of the Empire.
It requires further research, however the next step is clear: find an Astrium, if any still exist.
It requires more research. However...
It seems Cordova was rather taken with these Zeffo. Perhaps enough to hide the holocron amongst their bones.
It seems these candles were offerings brought to this tomb in exaltation of the Sage Miktrull.
It seems these sages held esteemed positions within their culture. 
It stores information but only accessible to Jedi.
It sure is, buddy. Let me install it.
It sure is. Do you mind?
It used to be beautiful.
It was Cordova's... he was troubled by endless war.
It was a carefully orchestrated breach.
It was a masterpiece, but now... Just don't be surprised if I send you a bill.
It was after bogling eggs and the pack fought back.
It was breathtaking.
It was foolish coming here. 
It was just in the way.
It was my dream job.
It was or you were? 
It was painful, but like I found a piece of myself.
It was the will of the Force that I found Bogano, and that I am here now.
It was too dangerous to light a pyre.
It was two Inquisitors.
It was, but worth every moment.
It was. Nature unbounded all around me; a blossoming cacophony of life itself.
It was. That's what I said, right? Oh... you're making a joke. Nice one. 
It was... You can still smell it.
It wasn't for nothing. Mari and Choyyssyk will come through.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't the droid's choice... it was mine.
It will be over soon, Jedi. 
It will take more than that.
It won't activate.
It won't budge! We're trapped!
It won't budge.
It won't help you. 
It won't open.
It won't respond.
It won't stop spreading!
It won't work.
It worked for Cordova.
It'd be fun to bring you in.
It'll be difficult. 
It'll be good for heading back.
It'll help us put an end to the Empire.
It'll take me a second. Hold on.
It'll take more than a slyyyg to kill me.
It's a Jedi fighter!
It's a challenge I'm willing to take.
It's a close combat fight now.
It's a giant Zeffo statue. Kinda thought there'd be Zeffo stuff inside.
It's a long drop!
It's a long story.
It's a long way down.
It's a lot tougher than it looks.
It's a one on one fight now...
It's a piece of the Ninth Sister's ship.
It's a place of torture.
It's a prototype, of course, but: it is going to change the galaxy.
It's a ranged battle now. I never was a good shot. 
It's a ranged battle now. Let's take him down. 
It's a ranged fight now!
It's a sign of unrest.
It's a tough decision: to kill or to torture. 
It's a very convenient location to dispose of nuisances.
It's a win/win for the Empire. They mine and refine wroshyr tree sap into valuable resources...
It's a... Is that a flame beetle?
It's a... bogling feeder? 
It's after me!
It's all close quarters now...
It's all lies. The Empire just wanted this land.
It's all over me!
It's all over now.
It's all over. Our flametrooper is down. 
It's almost done. 
It's always good to give yourself a moment to think and reflect.
It's always something.
It's always this bad with the Empire, but there's still a chance for your quest.
It's an honor to be alongside you, sir. 
It's an option. We can always come back here later if you're not ready, Cal.
It's an... echo in the Force from the object.
It's beautiful to see.
It's beautiful.
It's been a long time since I've been here.
It's been a while, but yeah. I remember.
It's been fun, Jedi.
It's been through hell.
It's being dealt with.
It's breaking through and destroying everything!
It's broken.
It's burning all over!
It's called a hallikset.
It's coming back! Hold on, buddy!
It's dangerous being on the run.
It's dangerous here. Saw's already gone, the casualties are just too high. 
It's definitely real.
It's difficult, Master. 
It's down.
It's easy if you just read it. 
It's everywhere!
It's fascinating. You must teach me to be a pilot.
It's fine! We're all fine. Don't you have Jedi stuff to do? Get to it, kid. 
It's fine. Perfectly adequate. Solidly average. Just barely cutting it.
It's fine... I've got more.
It's firing grenades!
It's from the Clone Wars.
It's getting there.
It's go time, look alive.
It's going to all work out.
It's going to blow!
It's gonna blow!
It's gonna take me a minute to get them back up.
It's good to believe in something.
It's good to have a Jedi on our side.
It's good to see you're safe.
It's got power now.
It's gotta be! Strange noises, weird smells, things going missing...
It's handled.
It's hard to believe he was ever a Jedi.
It's hard to believe how far you've come in such a short time, Cal.
It's hard to have friends when you have secrets.
It's hard to see what we did accomplish. 
It's hard to tell what their real goal is, but those crystals are powerful. 
It's hard to wait while our friends are down there.
It's headed for us. Can you do anything?
It's held up so far. 
It's him!
It's him.
It's him. 
It's huge now!
It's huge.
It's hurt. Think we can help it?
It's in the past. But Cal, you have to make a choice to move on.
It's infuriating.
It's just a job, kid. Don't overthink it.
It's just good to hear a friendly voice now and then.
It's just so dangerous up there.
It's like I can smell trouble.
It's like I'm back in that moment when...
It's like the dojo at the Jedi Temple.
It's like you said, Malicos. 
It's locked down.
It's locked. 
It's locked... what do you think?
It's made the ground unstable.
It's massive. I don't even know where to start.
It's massive. I see why Greez struggled to stick the landing.
It's more complicated than that.
It's my lucky day!
It's no way to live.
It's not about accuracy. It's about results: the end of the Jedi.
It's not about team spirit. Look, there are some parts of our past that we don't want to face, let alone share. 
It's not any of your business.
It's not easy to find something hidden from the Empire. 
It's not enough. 
It's not like any of us had it better before,
It's not luck. It's skill. At least, for me. 
It's not our fault if we don't find anything.
It's not over yet!
It's not over yet. 
It's not over, Jedi. 
It's not over. There's a lot more work to be done. 
It's not responding.
It's not safe.
It's not so bad. 
It's not the weapon, it's the person who wields it.
It's not too late to let it go.
It's not unlike some ancient Jedi temples I've seen.
It's not.
It's nothin'.
It's nothing you can't slice, though. Right?
It's nothing.
It's okay, BD. We'll find a different way in.
It's okay, Cere.
It's okay, Greez. You'll be okay. You're with Jedi. It's safe. I'm safe...
It's okay, buddy. Just ignore her.
It's okay.
It's okay. Next time maybe we can upgrade you with a heater before coming to an ice planet, huh?
It's only crawler blood.
It's only one Jedi. We'll get him.
It's our home. 
It's our job to trail you.
It's our mark!
It's our mark. Looks weak. 
It's over!
It's over, Trilla.
It's over.
It's over? And just when things were getting fun. 
It's over? He's dead? Good...
It's pointless, Jedi. 
It's possible, but we're far from Bracca. They might think Purge Troopers are enough.
It's possible.
It's probably just another contraband inspection.
It's probably nothing. Probably.
It's probably the altitude talking, but I think we can beat them.
It's quick.
It's quite different than Dathomir.
It's quittin' time.
It's remote... unexplored... mysterious... He loved that stuff. 
It's scary out there BD.
It's slowed considerably since the attack. 
It's so quiet since we relocated the villagers.
It's starting to grow.
It's still dangerous out there. 
It's strange.
It's strange... this planet is completely untouched by the Empire.
It's supposed to remind you that you're doing everything you can and that failure is not your fault - only giving up.
It's tempting to give in to absolutes when you suffer that much.
It's that Jedi!
It's that you always seem to get the job done.
It's the Brood!
It's the Empire!
It's the Jedi Temple.
It's the Jedi!
It's the Jedi! After him!
It's the Jedi! Get him!
It's the Mantis! Blast it!
It's the best news I've heard since coming here. Still... it's hard being away from her.
It's the choice to keep fighting that makes us who we are.
It's the least we could do.
It's the most secure place in this entire Fortress.
It's the nature of the mission, Captain. You knew the risks when you accepted the charter.
It's the only answer! I'm gonna find out who they are and where they've been hiding if it's the last thing I do.
It's the outsider!
It's the outsider! He's lowered the bridge!
It's the place I escaped.
It's the traitor! Blast 'em!
It's them. How did they find us here?
It's this water.
It's through there, I can feel it.
It's time I faced him.
It's time for something new.
It's time to call on an old friend.
It's time to call on an old friend. There's a good chance Chieftain Tarfful can provide the information I seek. 
It's time to end this.
It's time.
It's tipping!
It's too far.
It's too fast!
It's too heavy.
It's too high up.
It's too late, Cere.
It's too risky to start the engine. Its power discharge will draw their attention immediately.
It's true, Greez.
It's war by attrition... one we will soon win.
It's weird how two civilizations with no contact created similar monuments to the Force.
It's worth considering if we're gonna take out the target.
It's... dead?
It's... the charging... thing.
It's...nothing. 
Its electromagnetic winds have rendered the bulk of our mining technology useless.
Its powerful enough to rip arms right out of their sockets. 
Its visions shaped the direction of an entire culture. I must understand why.
J-Jedi!
J-Jedi! But... he's injured?

Just a little worse for wear.
Just a scratch!
Just a scratch.

Just as I suspected.
Just as planned.
Just as the war did.
Just be ready.
Just be safe, Cal. That's all. 
Just cargo, no civilians onboard. Cal, focus. We are looking for what Cordova came for.
Just checking in.
Just checking on you.
Just come out. 
Just couldn't beat us. 
Just destroy it!
Just die!
Just do it, stormtrooper.
Just do what I do: run away.
Just doing my job. 
Just don't be next...
Just don't get hit. Just don't get hit. Yeah. Easy.
Just drag it out.

Just fight already!

Just like the rest of your kind.
Just like they're after us.
Just like today. Thank you.
Just making sure you're still there.
Just me and the Jedi...
Just means more for me. 
Just more for me. 
Just need one clean hit. 
Just need to focus my mind.
Just need to keep moving.
Just need to know, don't you?
Just need to look at it a different way.
Just one hit. 
Just one need one hit.
Just part of our duties for the day. 
Just passin' through, guys.

Just rumors. Can't really discuss it.
Just saying...
Just showing off!
Just shut up and watch yourself. 
Just slick moves and brute force! Yah! Ha! Ooh-ooh!

Just so.
Just some basics I picked up in school.
Just stand and fight.
Just stand still!
Just stand your ground next time.
Just started getting worked.
Just stay away from them.

Just stop it. 
Just takes a minute to warm up.
Just tell me that this visit wasn't for nothin'.
Just too slow.

Just uh... don't do that to me, okay?
Just wait 'til the isolation.
Just wait, we'll get him!
Just watch out for him. He may have tricks. 
Just what I needed!
Just what we need. 
Just what we needed. 
Just when I thought they couldn't get uglier.
Just when you thought you were winning - surprise!
Just winged me. 
Just you and me Jedi.
Just you and me now.
Just you and me then. 
Just you and me, Jedi.
Just you and me, scum. 
Just you and me, snake. 
Just you and me, traitor.
Just you and me.
Just you wait, Jedi.
Just. Just find him. 
Just... don't, okay? Just don't do it.
Just... get back here!
Just... just watch him!
Just...more money for me then.
Justice for what they did to your home.
KX droid here!
KX droid! Slice it!
Kashyyyk is full of flame beetles. They are slow moving fauna that can be found on the ground or in trees.
Kashyyyk is not yet lost!
Kashyyyk is the worst.
Kashyyyk, I-look, things are really bad down there. The - the Empire's muscling in on those Wookiees big time.
Kashyyyk. Home of the Wookiees.
Kashyyyk? Okay. 
Keep aim on him.
Keep alert. Flametroopers down.
Keep an eye on him!

Keeping your distance?
Keeps eyes on him. 
Keeps your blasters on him. 
Kehkeheheh!
Kid, I don't know if you're messing around with me or not,
Kid, I need your help with this.
Kid, I'm afraid of bad lunch, let alone getting blasted or eaten. 
Kid, don't bug me until you give me the go ahead to get us off this planet.
Kid, not now. I've got thinkin' to do. 
Kid, you read me?
Kid... you see all this?

Less competition for me.

Let go!

Let's be careful. 
Let's break him!

Let's hope we don't find out.
Let's hope we never find out. 
Let's hurry back to post. We need to get our reports written. 
Let's inform command.
Let's install this, then.
Let's just call this in...
Let's just hope I never run into one again.
Let's just say I learned a bit of my risk taking from them...
Let's just take this thing out. 
Let's keep it up.
Let's keep looking. There must be something useful in this heap.
Let's keep making progress. 
Let's keep up.
Let's keep winning like that.
Let's kill that traitor!
Let's leave.
Let's level this thing. Hit him with something really nasty.

Let's move forward.
Let's move up!
Let's move, BD!
Let's not linger in this place.

Let's pick our next destination.
Let's plot a course.
Let's put an end to this!
Let's put an end to this.
Let's report this to command.
Let's run away!
Let's see if I can find a way outta here.
Let's see if I can string a few together.
Let's see what he's got!
Let's see what this is. 
Let's see what you found.
Let's see what's behind here. 
Let's see what's happening.
Let's see what's out there.
Let's stay away from fights for a while.
Let's take a look.
Let's take a look...
Let's take him on!
Let's take him out.
Let's take the fight to them!
Let's talk later, Cal.
Let's tear it down, BD-1.
Let's try it!
Let's try this again.
Let's wipe them out.
Let's wrap this up quick.
Let's... not do that again.
Let's... take a couple seconds.
Let. Me. Free. 
Lethargic movement.
Letting your emotions get the best of you?
Life has this funny way of forcing you on the path forward anyway.
Lightsaber.
Like I care. You're putting us both in danger. 
Like I need backup to kill you.
Like a frightened child.
Like a stowaway? They'd have to be pretty small, Greez. This ship isn't that big.
Like it was perfect before? 
Like it's inevitable.
Like rebuilding the Jedi Order.
Like showing off do you?
Like the focus.
Like what?
Like you said, Trilla.
Like you, BD-1.
Like yours?
Like yourself.
Lil' busy here Cal.
Listen to me. 
Listen to that water dripping.
Listen up! We've been through hell since coming to this miserable jungle.
Listen, I don't want to upset your rhythm, Cal, but the boss wants a word.
Listen, I know what my food smells like - it ain't that.
Listen, I've been in your shoes before, many times.
Listen, kid. In these times of war, does it really matter what you say?
Listen.
Listen...
Little buddy?
Little busy, kid. 
Little help, BD!
Little help?
Little in my life has gone how I thought it would, Cal Kestis.
Little jumpy?
Lively, aren't we?
Local fauna is highly aggressive. 
Local fauna is hostile.
Locate him. Now. 
Located a hostile!
Location.
Locked door, meet BD-1.
Locked tight.
Locked? Guess we should go home, huh?
Long enough. This world provided a sanctum when I was in need.
Long-range rockets terminated.
Long-range support consumed.
Long-range support's gone. Remain calm.
Look alive!
Look at him move.
Look at that shake.
Look at that.
Look at that...
Look at the Jedi go!
Look at this coward!
Look at this weakling!
Look at this. A lightsaber.
Look at those odds! I've never seen action like this.
Look at us, making progress. Maybe one day I'll show you how to replace a hyperdrive calibration tube.
Look buddy, a seed!
Look for a console nearby.
Look out!
Look out! Oh...
Look out. He's up there. 
Look over there, buddy
Look there. 
Look up there!
Look up!
Look up.
Look who has moves. 
Look! Above us!
Look! Below!
Look! Here!
Look! Under us!
Look! Up there!
Look, I didn't grow up with much. I mean, I had my great-grandmother to lean on, but that's it. 
Look, I didn't mean anything by it.
Look, I get it.
Look, I still don't quite get the whole Force stuff, but what I do know is that you are one tough kid.
Look, a workbench!
Look, before we do anything...
Look, if we succeed, then you have nothing to worry about. 
Look, kid. Be straight with me. Are we just marching to our deaths, because I'd like to know now?
Look, the point is Lateros have a keen sense of smell, that's why I'm such a good cook.
Look, the ship cutter is here!
Look. Below us. 
Look. Down there.
Look. Over there.
Look. The Jedi is weakened. 
Look. There. 
Lookie here!
Lookin' good. 
Lookin' scared Jedi!
Lookin' weak.
Looking for somebody.
Looking for something?
Looking good, buddy!
Looking good.
Looking into it.
Looking into it. 
Looking uneasy, Jedi. 
Looks at those odds change.
Looks climbable, but not without equipment.
Looks like a technician's bench.
Looks like a turbolift. Might be our ticket out of here.
Looks like a way through over there.
Looks like he wants a close range fight. 
Looks like he's weak. 
Looks like it's up to us now! Move up!
Looks like our guy.
Looks like our training paid off. 
Looks like something goes here.
Looks like something is meant to fit here.
Looks like that was our last gunner. 
Looks like that was out last rocket trooper. 
Looks like the Zeffo were here.
Looks like the wind's about to burst through these shafts. Maybe we can help it along.
Looks like they're healthy.
Looks like we know what we have to find.
Looks like we might be able to break through this wall.
Looks like we still have work to do.
Looks like we're all out of droids. 
Looks like you're blocked. I'll fix that.
Looks like your bounty's all mine.
Looks lonely in there. Better find more seeds.
Looks pretty dead in there.
Looks so good, but I can't eat.
Lose them in the canyons.
Losing balance.
Lost artillery.
Lost him.
Lost him. 
Lost more than that from what I heard.
Lost now...
Lost target. 
Lost the enemy. 
Lost visual contact again. 
Lost... and defenseless in this dangerous place?
Loud and clear.
Love? You?
Luck favors you. 
Luck's on my side. 
Luckily we found you.
Luckily, I always allow for contingencies.
Lucky I let you live. 
Lucky block.
Lucky block. 
Lucky hit.
Lucky move. 
Lucky. 
Lying Imps! You think anyone buys this junk?
Lying to a superior is a court martial offense.
M-mykal! 
Mad isn't the word I'd use.
Made it out in one piece.
Main directives modified.
Maintain ranged tactics.
Maintaining a ship like this ain't no easy task, you know.
Make a break for it!
Make him hurt! End him!
Make him pay for taking out our gunners!
Make him pay!
Make him pay. 
Make him stop!
Make him stop. 
Make it stop!
Make some space!
Make sure to watch the sky. Don't want a mykal to get you. 
Make your shots count.
Make. Me. Money!
Makes me want to learn magick.
Making a new friend?
Making friends, Greez. Good for you.
Making friends? 
Malicos lies ahead. You could turn back.
Malicos may not be here, but Dathomir is still dangerous. Be aware of your surroundings. 
Malicos said many things too.
Malicos wanted me to attack them, but they posed no threat.
Malicos wanted me to, but they posed no threat.
Malicos, no!
Malicos, you monster!
Malicos.
Man down! 
Man your post. He might come back.
Many stormtroopers have failed to eliminate this Jedi for the Empire. I will not.
Many were kept in the Archives of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
Mari and Tarfful put their trust in me. Did I just endanger them again?
Mari said you were overrun... I didn't realize it would be this bad.
Mari! Are you okay?
Mari's mapped out the nearest garrisons. The Empire won't have time to send reinforcements.
Mari, are you there? I'm almost to the Shadowlands. at the wreck of a walker.
Mari, lay down covering fire!
Mari, protect the prisoners!
Mari.
Mark is up there. 
Mark located. 
Marseph... you must go. They're still searching for you.
Mashing opponent.
Massive fauna inbound.
Master Kestis, why?
Master Kestis.
Master Tapal taught me courage through strict discipline.
Master Tapal's called me for training.
Master Tapal, I...
Master Tapal... he was different.
Master Tapal?
Master Yoda guided us to the entrance, but after that, we were on our own.
Master!
Master!?
Master, don't leave us!
Master, shall we fight them?
Master, should we fight?
Master, what's happened to them?
Master.
Master? Are you okay?
Master?!
Mawrrr...
Maximum effort.
May the Force be with us.
May the Force be with you, Cal.
May the Force be with you.
Maybe Cere was right.
Maybe I should check the sensors anyway?
Maybe I should take up gardening.
Maybe I shouldn't have hit him. 
Maybe I'll find something good.
Maybe I'll teach you one day, when you're done with your Jedi stuff. I'll even give you a discount...
Maybe a little bruised, but that's not so bad.
Maybe after all of this, we'll both be promoted to Purge Troopers.
Maybe below us?
Maybe down there?
Maybe he needs something bigger?
Maybe he's down there. 
Maybe he's up there.
Maybe it still is.
Maybe it's just a droid?
Maybe not a jotaz though. I saw one kill another stormtrooper in one hit.
Maybe not what we have to do, but how we go about it.
Maybe not you.
Maybe one day I'll teach you how to fight.
Maybe place a bet or two.
Maybe so, but that's no reason to get too comfortable. We have a mission.
Maybe some Oven-roasted Tip Yip with Yobshrimp. Now where am I going to get fresh food like that around here? 
Maybe something around here can help.
Maybe spend less time complaining and more time watching and you wouldn't get bitten.
Maybe that was the lesson, Cal.
Maybe the Jedi already passed through here. We should head back.
Maybe the kid dragged something in. 
Maybe there are some historic artifacts or something? I mean we are digging.
Maybe this'll get exciting. 
Maybe we can get up there. 
Maybe we should go take a look?
Maybe we should leave.
Maybe we'll both get recognized for our devotion to the Empire.
Maybe we'll see some action in here.
Maybe we're done hiding.
Maybe when all this is over, I can show you the Origin Tree and some of its friendlier residents.
Maybe you should come down and face me yourself.
Maybe you should try these on for size...
Maybe you should, you know, disappear?
Maybe your orders, but not mine.
Maybe.
Maybe. Could be. I have been missing some food lately. Weird smells. Oh, do droids smell?
Maybe. Either way, I'm ready.
Maybe. I don't often feel up to it these days...
Maybe. Or maybe this storm is a consequence of the Zeffo. With phenomena so ancient, it's hard to tell which came first.
Maybe. Or maybe this was all a bad idea. Saw's gone, the Empire's back...
Maybe. Sure seemed enthusiastic about making others suffer.
Maybe. Think we should call it in?
Maybe...which group?
Me and her got an understanding. I'll be fine. We've got bigger problems to worry about.
Me neither.
Me neither. 
Me too. Let's keep checking.
Me, myself, and I.
Me? No. No. Me scared? No. Just saying hello.
Me? Oh yeah, I'm fine. I'm just a little tense. Not used to all this action.
Me? Oh, yeah. Not a problem. It's easy for a skilled pilot like myself, especially when flying a ship like this.
Me? Right now, the Mantis.
Meaningless resistance.
Meanwhile, more stormtroopers lose their lives to dangerous fauna. 
Mediocre.
Meditating here I was granted a premonition through the Force. A vision of doom.
Meet you at the clamps!
Meet your death.
Melee support down.
Melee support down. Keep steady. 
Melee unit, move in.
Memories that have haunted me since Bracca...
Merciless. 
Merely a slip.
Merrin - I'm in the Tomb of Kujet. When we fought Malicos he was unhinged, out of control.  But he wasn't always like that, right?
Merrin, do your tattoos mean something?
Merrin, right?
Merrin, this could be the key to the next generation of Jedi.
Merrin. Please tell me I'm not gonna run into another one of those giant bats.
Might be able to tether another object here.
Might be below us.
Might be deep underground.
Might be spare parts over there.
Mind doing an overcharge? 
Mind helping me out?
Mind helping out?
Mind the drop. You never know what you'll find in the pits of Dathomir.
Mind the ricochet.
Mind the space gate.
Mind tossing me a stim?
Mine's the Outlander Club. Won some memorable sabacc pots there.
Mirienna... take care of our Sienna.
Missed!
Missed.
Mission success. Let's head back. 
Mistakes happen, all we can do is try to learn and move on.
Monster...
Months on this planet and I still can't hit a mykal.
More Nightbrothers.
More advanced than expected.
More coming. 
More credits for me.
More flavor or you had enough flavor. And no matter how long it took, in the end, it was always the best meal I'd ever have. 
More for me. 
More gambling?
More of my soldiers breach this tomb every minute.
More of that coming.
More skilled than I thought. 
More slippery than I thought...
More than you realize.
More troopers ahead. 
More undead!
More where that came from. 
More! Give me more!
More. 
Mornin'
Mortality probable.
Most of us weren't fighters, we were traders and dealers. That's probably worse though...
Mostly that you weren't thrilled to have me on board. I'm the captain of this ship!
Mother.
Mother...
Move back!
Move back.
Move faster!
Move faster. 
Move forward!
Move forward, Brothers. 
Move foward!
Move in on him!
Move in on him. 
Move in on it.
Move in on the Jedi.
Move in!
Move in, Brothers. 
Move in. 
Move in. Closer. 
Move in. End him. 
Move it!
Move out and line up.
Move out!
Move out.
Move up already. 
Move up slowly, Brothers. 
Move up!
Move up! 
Move up! Now!
Move up. 
Move up. Close combat only. 
Move up. He's got a stim! 
Move up. Now. 
Move!
Move! 
Move! Move!
Move! Scazz here!
Move, padawan! We have to leave now!
Move.
Move. Let me destroy it.
Move. Let's check it out.
Move. Phillak.
Movement ahead.
Movement detected. 
Movement there. 
Movement. 
Movement. Hold for confirmation. 
Moving back.
Moving back. 
Moving in to attack. 
Moving in.
Moving out.
Moving to engage!
Moving to investigate.
Moving to investigate. 
Moving to target. 
Moving. 
Mow 'em down!
Much better, BD.
Much better.
Music does that, you know? Almost heals you, even when you're in the darkest place.
Must be frustrating, being so slow. 
Must be hard watching all your friends get gunned down. I mean, ya know... purged, or whatever.
Must it mean something? Too many great minds have gone astray in pursuit of... order.
Mutilation.
My Friend, After my analysis of the architecture in Eilram's Tomb, I confirmed the Zeffo had contact with Kashyyyk!
My Friend, Entering the Vault gave me a premonition just as it did for the Zeffo.
My Friend, I believe this to be the earliest Zeffo site we've uncovered yet.
My Friend, I finally found an intact representation of the most sacred Zeffo artifact. 
My Friend, I flew with all haste to Coruscant and presented my findings to the Council.
My Friend, I found my quarry atop Kashyyyk's Origin Tree: the Astrium.
My Friend, I recently discovered the Zeffo had some interest in Dathomir. 
My Friend, I've unearthed a curious artifact.
My Friend, My name is Jedi Master Eno Cordova.
My Friend, Never have I seen a view more exquisite than atop this tree.
My Friend, This tomb is utterly fascinating.
My Friend, This tomb is utterly fascinating. 
My Friend, as Tarfful led us here he spoke of a glorious creature called the Shyyyo Bird.
My Friend, examinations of the sphere proved fruitful.
My Friend, these devices appear to simulate this planet's gravitational pull. I can't help but see it as a motif.
My Friend, we've reached the tomb of Kujet in search of an Astrium.
My Friend, what I've found here is disconcerting.
My Partisans could use a Jedi on our side.
My aim is true. 
My apologies, I do not mean to distract you from the mission.
My blaster was malfunctioning earlier. Hopefully it's fixed now.
My blood is on your hands, apprentice.
My blows will find you. 
My body won't move. 
My bones are telling me trouble is near.
My child already lost one parent. I can't stay.
My companions and I came to Kashyyyk to disrupt Imperial supply lines.
My connection to the Force is damaged.
My crew, they might take a little bit of convincing, though.
My death is on your head.
My ears are pounding.
My fallen sisters...
My family came here on vacation once.
My favorite is the Chant of Resurrection. If you care to hear it.
My focus has, and always will be, the murderous Jedi I seek to eradicate. 
My footing!
My friend, I have never been one to shy away from the pursuit of knowledge.
My friend, in the rotations since I left Bogano I've uncovered more about the Zeffo than I once believed possible.
My friend, look closely.
My friend, take a look at the detail on this bark!
My friend.
My fuel line went up!
My great-grandma had too many culinary secrets to count. But I gotta admit, this batch was extra special. 
My great-grandma. Parents weren't really around much. Wasn't easy on Lateron.
My guard is strong.
My guard persists.
My hand won't falter!
My hands are still shaking.
My helmet's got a smudge on the visor. Might be hard to blast. 
My job is to guide you on your path, not choose it for you. 
My leg's pinned.
My lieutenants and I will scout ahead to prepare the attack.
My lightsaber is missing.
My magick can.
My master gave it to me.
My master once described the Force exactly like that. 
My master taught me a few things, but I learned to defend myself on Bracca. 
My master wasn't a fierce warrior like yours, but he taught me courage. I was never timid to face danger.
My master will have his prize...
My men are scouting the wreckage now. We'll find him.
My men will double our efforts, we'll get inside, Officer Krane.
My mind is sharp.
My money's on you, kid.
My name is Cere Junda.
My only directive is to kill you. I will not fail.
My partner.
My patience is waning. 
My patience wears thin.
My research has uncovered small details of this Imperial operation. They're calling it Project Siphon.
My scouts located an artifact of interest at the rear of this tomb. Even now I'm studying it, learning his secrets.
My search commences. 
My sisters.
My skill gives me the advantage. 
My skill is superior.
My squad's headed into the Shadowlands to rout the rest of the locals.
My stance is solid. 
My strength will aid me. 
My time to shine.
My time to shine. 
My training is paying off. 
My training will aid me.
My training won't fail me. 
My troops betrayed me.
My weapon ignited!
My weapon's on fire!
My work is done here.
Mykal approaching.
Mykal have no known natural defense against Imperial weaponry.
Mykal inbound
Mykal incoming!
Mykal incoming.
Mykal over here.
Mykal up here.
Mykal! Coming in!
Mykal! Here!
Mykal! Kill it!
Mykal! Over here!
Mykal. Here.
N-no!
N-no!!
N-not possible!
NO!
Nah, I'm good.
Nah, cool your jets. I'm sure it's nothing.
Nah, haven't- waaaiit a minute this has to be the work of our stowaway!
Nah. I'm just... curious.
Nah. There's a lot of things that bother me:
Name it. Fighters, freighters, short range, long range, whatever. I flew circles around everybody.
Nature is just so dirty... I hate this planet.
Need a break. 
Need a jolt here, buddy. 
Need a jolt here.
Need a moment? 
Need a pick-me-up.
Need a stim!
Need an assist!
Need anything, Greez?
Need cover!
Need some help here. 
Need to charge this. 
Need to follow protocol. 
Need to get some seeds in here.
Need to jump over.
Need to move closer.
Need to open this. 
Need to overcharge this. 
Need to patch up?
Need to pull that to get through.
Need to reload. 
Need to slice this door. 
Need to slice this. 
Need to sprint!
Need you to charge this, BD. 
Need your stims, huh?
Negative. The refinery is no longer our priority.
Never a good idea to stand still when the Empire is hunting you down...just sayin'.
Never complained? On that trash heap?
Never felt such rage before.
Never know when one of those droids are listening.
Never mess with the Brood.
Never really had much family except my great-grandma, but it's fine. Family's a bit overrated.
Never seen a storm do that before.
Never seen a trooper like that before. You've got to get these Wookiees out of lockup. Keep moving, Jedi.
Never seen anything like this. Advanced, even for the Empire.
Never seen that before.
Never seen that before. 
Never send a droid to do an assassin's job.
Never thought I'd be so happy to see a crate.
Never thought I'd be the last one standing. 
Never.
Never. There's no protocol to follow.
New hostile located.
New information came to light.
Next let's go to...
Next time we find one of those plant things don't go near it.
Nice assist.
Nice block!
Nice catch.
Nice dodge!
Nice hit!
Nice job!
Nice job, BD.
Nice job, Cal. 
Nice job.
Nice job. 
Nice landing, Greez.
Nice moves Jedi. 
Nice moves, Jedi. 
Nice throw, BD.
Nice trick.
Nice try!
Nice try, kid. 
Nice try.
Nice try. 
Nice work out there, kid. Hey, you got some real moves on ya. Ha!
Nice work.
Nice work. The Empire will be happy. 
Nice!
Nice! Wait, where you going now?
Nice, buddy.
Nice, careful next time.
Nice. 
Nice. They offered me that position too, but I didn't want to leave my post. 
Nice. You remembered. You joining me?
Night witch.
Nightbrother runes? Think we're getting close to a village?
Nightsister magick is ancient, but my connection with the past is not as vivid as yours.
Nightsister.
Nightsisters and Jedi do not travel together but...
Nightsisters are very powerful. Be ready for anything out there. 
Nightsisters channel magick through ourselves; we do not let it consume us.
Ninth?! We already got a Second Sister tailing us. Please don't tell me there more of 'em.
Nngh, huh!
No Jedi is getting into this sector on my watch.
No Stormtroopers here either. Must've cleared out to search for the tomb.
No alternative either. Can you imagine what they'd do to us if we went AWOL?
No bounty today...
No chance!
No close range units. Might be too tough to handle. 
No contact, where is he?
No escape. 
No fight? 
No getting past that. Let's find another way.
No good.
No guards?
No intruders detected. Should we report in?
No it won't! It's going to be this way forever!
No magicks. Only weapons.
No match for you, right?
No matter how much training we have, a Jedi could defeat dozens of us. 
No melee units? Just means a clear line of sight.
No mention of Cordova. I don't think the Empire knows he's been here.
No more artillery support.
No more artillery. 
No more distractions!
No more distractions. 
No more droid support.
No more droid support. I'll try to advance on the target. 
No more droids. It's just us stormtroopers. 
No more droids...
No more flametrooper support!
No more flametrooper support. 
No more flametroopers.
No more flametroopers. 
No more flametroopers...
No more gunners. 
No more gunners. Figures.
No more hardware troops.
No more heavy artillery!
No more heavy artillery.
No more heavy support. 
No more heavy support...
No more incendiary troops.
No more melee.
No more range support.
No more range support. But we've got this!
No more ranged backup, this is gonna be tricky.
No more ranged troopers. 
No more ranged troopers. This might be tough. 
No more ranged units in this sector. 
No more rocket troopers. 
No more rocket units.
No more rockets!
No more security droids. 
No need for you to understand. Only to believe.
No need to come out and say, Hi, this time...
No need to return to Dathomir.
No need to tell me. 
No no!
No one escapes the Brood!
No one intrudes on our lands. 
No one is that fast.
No one saves me, okay? If anything you got in the way.
No one stands against us. 
No one threatens the Brood.
No one will stand in my way. 
No one's ever escaped us.
No one's that fast!
No outsider can beat us. 
No outsider will pass by us. 
No pain will stop me. 
No problem, I'll improvise.
No problem.
No problem...
No promises there.
No promises.
No reaction.
No response.
No retreating. Stay on him. 
No right to our magick.
No sign of Tarfful, but we did find out the safest route to the Shadowlands is through this refinery.
No sign of an enemy counterattack.
No sign of intruders in Besh sector.
No sign of that old man.
No sign of the little one. 
No sign of them down here.
No survivors! Shoot him!
No thank you?
No threat will take us down.
No time to hesitate.
No time to relax. Prepare for the next fight. 
No time!
No train to save you this time.
No tricks. 
No turnin' back once we make the jump to lightspeed.
No way across.
No way through here. Guess that's why BD-1 warned me.
No way.
No way. I'll watch a fight.
No we are not. 
No wonder Master Cordova became so obsessed with them. What else did you find?
No wonder your master died.
No!
No! 
No! Cere...
No! He is too powerful!
No! Lieutenant Tallus chewed me out for it during lineup.
No! No stop!
No! No!!
No! No, no, no!
No! Not like this!
No! Not yet!
No! Stop!
No! You can't leave!
No, Captain.
No, I can only guess at who she was as a Jedi.
No, I know I could have helped him if I'd been stronger and braver, if I would have listened to him.
No, I mean with us? With me. This whole... thing. 
No, I'm going to lure them away and then I'm going to circle back.
No, I'm not alright. It's hard to be here.
No, Jedi!
No, Jedi. 
No, Jedi. Not today. 
No, actually. That's why I started playing the hallikset when I was a Padawan. It was always soothing.
No, and the Empire's been stepping up security.
No, because they're so hard to find since they hide all the time. Heh heh. 
No, but I helped capture one. They got what they deserved and so will this one.
No, but I'd love to hear it.
No, but I-I seen them. I've-I've seen the stories. I've heard it. There's...
No, but considering what they did to the Jedi,
No, but the hilt's intact. I used it to repair my weapon.
No, but the hilt's intact. I'm taking it with me.
No, but the smell attracts scazz. You didn't leave them open?
No, don't be. I'm glad I know the truth.
No, don't let go!
No, failure is not the end.
No, he's not. Malicos had a knack for strategy and... motivating his troops.
No, if you leave the Wookiees lose support.
No, it's a rare thing. I think I was born with it.
No, it's not, but I think of those who believed in me at one point.
No, it's okay. I'll find her.
No, it's true. Mostly myth and legend. How do you feel about that? You're a legend already.
No, mostly just scrapper transports on Bracca.
No, no aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No, no! Don't do this, brothers!
No, no, no, no. No!
No, not anymore.
No, sir. You're right, sir. I will man my post.
No, stop!
No, they spotted me. And that's not all...
No, wait!
No, we are not doing that again.
No, we are not.
No, we didn't come all this way to be captured. I'll be there.
No, we take him to Brother Viscus.
No, we're not here to raid tombs. But... I found something else. A Republic Venator. Crashed in the lake.
No, you cannot die!
No, you kidding me? Lateros don't do well in the cold.
No, you use the Force to seize power. That's - 
No.
No. 
No. Actually, he never brought me here. He did tell me about it. I was the only one who knew of its location.
No. But that doesn't mean he didn't bring me along on other expeditions.
No. But to wield anger as a weapon and use hatred as a purpose, that is a feeling I know. And it is hard to resist.
No. I hope I never have to.
No. I won't let anyone touch them.
No. It means I'm a Seeker too!
No. It's not. We did find you, though.
No. No yet. 
No. No!
No. No, no no, no. No, no. I... I got scared.
No. No.
No. Not like mine. Smaller!
No. Not yet.
No. Not yet. 
No. Not you.
No. These witches served only themselves.
No. Wasn't Imperial.
No. We're stronger together. Don't get ahead of yourself.
No...!
No? Did you?
No? Obligations. Guilt. Presents. It's a lot of pressure.
No? Then stay out of my way. The key to victory is conviction.
Nobody around? Think it's some kind of trap?
Nobody down there was keen on making friends.
Noise over there. 
None can face us!
None may stand against the Empire!
None stand before the Nightbrothers!
None will stand before us.
Nonsense!
Nooooo!
Nope!
Nope.
Nope. Had to try.
Nope. Someone else will take care of it. 
Normally I wouldn't waste my time with the likes of insurgents.
Not Wise!
Not a bad idea. You two have spent a lot of time together.
Not a clue. They seek things?
Not a droid guy. I'm gonna say it. Nothing against them. They're fine... things, but
Not a fan of nature, Greez?
Not a wyyyyshokk...
Not again!
Not all of them.
Not all.
Not all. Mari is staying behind with Choyyssyk and Tarfful. Some of our troops went with them.
Not an easy target.
Not an easy task - are you sure you're up to it?
Not anymore.
Not as good as I would do it.
Not as weak as I thought.
Not bad back there. We've had some close calls. Hey, remember Todola?
Not bad for trash.
Not bad!
Not bad. 
Not bad. I expect to see flying like that on this trip.
Not by us.
Not completely. Cal, did I ever tell you what Greez told me about the Mantis before I hired him? 
Not crazy about this assignment. Too many unknowns.
Not done with you yet. 
Not enough to down me. 
Not enough.
Not even Tarfful could keep them out forever.
Not even a scratch.
Not even your Temple? I saw the inside once, y'know. 
Not everyone. I ran into this wanderer. He called himself a scholar. Said he came to study Dathomir.
Not exactly to plan...
Not falling for it.
Not fast enough!
Not fast enough.
Not fast enough. 
Not feeling so great, BD.
Not for a Jedi.
Not from you.
Not getting away. 
Not givin' up. 
Not going to get away.
Not gonna stop me!
Not gonna work!
Not good, but not unexpected. Keep exploring. I'll watch in case they get too close.
Not good, but not unexpected. Keep exploring. I'll watch in case they get too close. 
Not good.
Not happening!
Not happening.
Not here to have a conversation right now. 
Not how I saw that going.
Not how I wanted it to go...
Not impressive.
Not just that! Those slubs give a lot credits to the winner of the grand prize!
Not likely. 
Not liking this.
Not long now, Jedi. 
Not many Jedi have that skill.
Not many. I've been tending to the hearth.
Not me, I got myself a collection of my great-grandma's old recipes.
Not me. I leave nothing. 
Not much further after that.
Not much going on outside.
Not much longer.
Not much more now. 
Not much of a fight.
Not much to see is there?
Not my best performance.
Not nearly as brave though.
Not now! 
Not now, Cal.
Not now, Cal. I need to focus.
Not now, Cal. I need to focus. 
Not now. 
Not now. I got work to do. 
Not now...
Not on my watch!
Not only that - they paid for my list of recipes! 
Not only them.
Not our most skilled stormtrooper. 
Not part of your plan?
Not possible...
Not quick enough!
Not quick enough. 
Not quite as gifted as Cere's last apprentice but not bad.
Not quite like fireworks...
Not ready for this.
Not really.
Not right now.
Not so close!
Not so close.
Not so close. 
Not so easy, are we?
Not so fast.
Not so fast. 
Not something I wasn't accustomed to, but that didn't make it any less challenging.
Not sure if I saw movement. 
Not sure what I just heard. 
Not sure what I'm seeing. 
Not sure what that was...
Not sure. We won the day, but there's still a fleet of destroyers in orbit.
Not surprising, very few did. Most of what I know is from Cordova. He had his reasons for coming here.
Not that I'm aware of. And they definitely don't eat.
Not that good. But I think my luck's turning around. 
Not the Jedi, but the Sith. And their Empire.
Not the fuel!
Not the hardest bounty I've taken down. 
Not there!
Not this again.
Not this time.
Not this time. 
Not today Jedi!
Not today!
Not today, Jedi. 
Not today. 
Not too different from Dathomir. I lost my sisters to war.
Not too different from the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
Not too different from the people here.
Not unarmed.
Not until we've destroyed the rest of the resistance here.
Not with attitudes like that it won't.
Not with that attitude you won't. 
Not with the Force. With that crystal. The light passed through it and carried its warmth.
Not worried.
Not yet!
Not yet, but I've been preparing for this a long time. I'm ready.
Not yet. I was on prisoner duty this morning and haven't had a chance.
Noted.
Nothing but air...
Nothing can stop me. Not even you. 
Nothing can stop you. You're a pro. Right? Where'd you learn to access that Imperial network anyway?
Nothing good.
Nothing good. Everything that moves here is trying to kill me.
Nothing is ever truly over.
Nothing is happening.
Nothing is making it work.
Nothing new, but still feels risky. 
Nothing on the holonet about it either.
Nothing special.
Nothing stands against us, Brothers. 
Nothing stops you. 
Nothing unites people like tragedy. Everything the Empire takes from us only makes us stronger.
Nothing will happen to you. We're all in this together, Greez.
Nothing! I'm telling you, I think there's something going on with the Mantis.
Nothing.
Notification: Pursuing intruder. 
Now drop me!
Now here I am.
Now how do we get on top...
Now hurry up and let's get outta here.
Now it's destroyed.
Now it's different.
Now it's getting even stronger. I think the closer we are, the worse I feel.
Now it's on!
Now let's make things interesting.
Now strike!
Now that's bravery. 
Now that's the best news I've heard all day. I'll take that challenge. I'll make them pay.
Now that's what I call a fight!
Now the fear creeps in. I like that.
Now this is no fair. 
Now we have to deal with a jotaz.
Now we hold them.
Now what do we do?
Now what was that?
Now what's this?
Now where could we find a new scomp link...
Now where did he go. 
Now where did you go?
Now where'd he go?
Now where'd you go?
Now who taught you that?
Now why'd you do that?
Now you die, Malicos!
Now you'll pay.
Now you're gonna hurt!
Now!
Now! Into the refinery!
Now, BD!
Now, BD-1!
Now, I know I don't know much about the Force thing or which side is the good side, but magick sure sounds dark to me.
Now, I understand that there's more of us on the Mantis than originally expected, so I'll go easy on you...
Now, Jedi or not, you are.
Now, back in the fight!
Now, before they regroup!
Now, buddy!
Now, do what you must to reach me.
Now, end this!
Now, let's finish this.
Now, reach my position.
Now, we finish this!
Now. Let's finish this. 
Now. Where should we go next?
Now...
Now... again.
Nuh-uh!
Number four: if it gets too loud, you'll be flying in the clouds.
Number three: if anyone's cooking, Greez will be looking.
Nydaks near the village again.
O-Oh, you don't have to worry about me.
O-Okay, maybe not change the whole galaxy, but it's almost done.
OUR home. We're all in this together. The same cause. We're family; what happened to yours, happened to mine.
Objective complete.
Observation. I've seen many things since coming here.
Observe your surroundings. Trust the Force to guide your path. Use what you've learned. 
Observe. 
Observing a threat.
Obtained.
Obvious.
Obviously the Empire does. Else we wouldn't be here. 
Occupied!
Odds of victory have dropped... substantially. 
Of a cook? I know, I've heard. You can just pilot the ship.
Of course I did! Who doesn't take patrol notes?
Of course not.
Of course she can, I don't know if you are aware but this ship is beautiful masterpiece of a machine!
Of course some of them will be. That's why we're here.
Of course the work is dangerous. You're a Rigger!
Of course we did. It was only a matter of time.
Of course we do.
Of course you are. You're always excited, aren't you?
Of course you found something.
Of course you would say that, whatever it means.
Of course, Cere had her doubts when she first came on board.
Of course, loans need to be paid back, but don't worry. It's my problem. We've all got 'em.
Of course, they didn't make it any easier for themselves. 
Of course.
Of course. 
Of course. But Project Siphon is still fully operational.
Of impressionable students.
Of waiting for a chance to avenge my sisters.
Offensive strike on living being.
Official probe underway.
Oh , too quick for you. 
Oh , you're in trouble, Jedi. 
Oh BD-1, this is Greez. Hey, Greez!
Oh alright then.
Oh come now!
Oh come on. 
Oh dear.
Oh for sure. Nothing bad at all.
Oh friend, you've made some poor life choices.
Oh great. He's got stims.
Oh great. Our droid's down.
Oh great. Scazz. 
Oh great. Stims.
Oh he's fast.
Oh he's hurting!
Oh he's shaking!
Oh hey, uh, change of plans. We're arriving.
Oh kid, you gotta get in the cockpit sometime.
Oh look at that!
Oh look, he's scared!
Oh no oh no oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no! He got away. 
Oh no! He was our last flametrooper!
Oh no! He's got stims!
Oh no! No way. Not on my ship!
Oh no! That's our last gunner...
Oh no, he's gone again!
Oh no, is that it for our hero?!
Oh no, that was our last ranged trooper!
Oh no.
Oh no. Absolutely not. I just wanted to say, you know... those kids we're supposed to find, they're lucky to have you.
Oh no. He's hurt. 
Oh no. I'm next. 
Oh no. It's just me.
Oh no. Now he looks mad. 
Oh no. Oh no no no.
Oh no. Oh no!
Oh no. Our droid is down.
Oh no. That was our last gunner.
Oh no. That's our last flametrooper.
Oh no. That's our last rocket trooper.
Oh no. There's more of them?
Oh no. Was that our last melee unit? 
Oh now he's recovering...
Oh now he's running.
Oh okay.
Oh only as a last resort. I've rigged the Mantis' transponder to transmit Imperial signals. Hey, Greez.
Oh really? 
Oh shut up.
Oh sorry. I can't hear you through my busted eardrum!
Oh this is fun. 
Oh this will be quick. 
Oh well, next!
Oh yeah! I listed off eighteen different ways to prepare them, from smoked to raw.
Oh yeah, he's scared. 
Oh yeah, no, of course. I'm-I'm just a spectator. No gambling or nothing going on.
Oh yeah, right. That thing. You used to play it a lot.
Oh yeah, yeah, that's true. That's very very true. Yeah, lots of people trying to kill us now. Wasn't that way before.
Oh yeah. I remember our first visit here. I've said it before, I really didn't think you were...
Oh yeah. I'm fine. Great. Wonderful but mostly sarcastic. 
Oh yeah. Seekers. They are one of a kind, I'll tell ya that much.
Oh yeah. She's great company. Heh. What about you? How long were you alone on Bracca?
Oh yeah. There's that. Nothing worse than that though. Right?
Oh yeah. Well, we got word there was a Jedi in hiding there. We had to follow up.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah? What did you think about me?
Oh you want to play?
Oh you're dead. 
Oh you're mine.
Oh!
Oh! (laughs)
Oh! A quick one!
Oh! Almost got through. 
Oh! Another stim module.
Oh! Ha ha, okay.
Oh! He's bleedin'!
Oh! He's gone again. 
Oh! He's hurting!
Oh! Hold on. 
Oh! I can smell the credits!
Oh! Nice dodge!
Oh! Somebody get baby his toy.
Oh! Up there!
Oh, Cal. I was just referring to my plant. I can see how that might be confusing.
Oh, Good. Good. So you just sat there laughing at them like you're laughing at me. Everyone's having a grand old time.
Oh, Greez.
Oh, I am. I really am. 
Oh, I bet that hurt!
Oh, I didn't know that was a thing.
Oh, I hope you found something better out there than this droid.
Oh, I will never be able to thank Tarfful enough.
Oh, I will. The longer I stay alive, the more Imps I get to take out.
Oh, I won't do a thing.
Oh, I'll get through. 
Oh, Okay.
Oh, bad choice. 
Oh, be careful.
Oh, brutal. 
Oh, calm down Greez. He did.
Oh, come on!
Oh, come on. Some of them are even richer than before! Not like the expendable worlds. Not like Lateron.
Oh, did that sting?
Oh, don't give up yet!
Oh, fellow wanderer!
Oh, fine. I'll stay... Hey, so you wanna learn how to cook?
Oh, great! It's just me then?
Oh, he's got stims. 
Oh, he's moving!
Oh, heh... great.
Oh, here he goes.
Oh, here we go...
Oh, hey Cal.
Oh, hey. Is anybody hungry?
Oh, hi there!
Oh, huh, well I...
Oh, it was special. It was the patience she put into making it. Slow cook the Braised Shaak Roast from the night before,
Oh, nice!
Oh, no!
Oh, not again. 
Oh, she does. It's just... hard to take that smiling face of yours seriously.
Oh, so close!
Oh, something was in there.
Oh, stronger than that! They can rip a person right in two. 
Oh, sure. I'm really in the mood for a slow and painful death. Think you can find me that sorta thing on this death planet?
Oh, that's cute. Real cute.
Oh, that's it!
Oh, this can't be good.
Oh, this is bad.
Oh, uh, just remembered. I'm thinking of a different battle. Weird, huh?
Oh, uh, not yet.
Oh, uh... okay. Hop on board.
Oh, um... Sorry about that. That's me. I had some roast nuna legs a little bit ago.
Oh, we're not good enough for you?
Oh, well, that's... that's great to hear. Since I'm currently navigating the galaxy looking for a list of Jedi with two...
Oh, what do you know. You've probably never even flown a ship.
Oh, yeah, I mean... it is. True. Totally barbaric. But still... Kind of entertaining.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yes! Fight!
Oh, yes. I know your name...
Oh, yes. Of course. Got it. 
Oh, you fixed it.
Oh, you found something!
Oh, you little...
Oh, you poor fool.
Oh, you're goin' down. 
Oh, you're in trouble. 
Oh, you're not getting away.
Oh, you've killed them all.
Oh-whoah!
Oh.
Oh. (laugh)
Oh. Glad you haven't let it hold you back, Captain.
Oh. Hey. 
Oh. It's you. 
Oh. Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?
Oh. The Jedi is hurting!
Oh. They're that strong, huh?
Oh. Well, that's kinda nice.
Oh. Yeah, I guess you're right.
Oh. You going to help out next time we're in a fight?
Oh. You've learned a new trick.
Oh... He must have left right after you were activated. Do you remember the last thing Cordova said to you?
Oh... okay. Good to know. Thanks for the information. 
Oh... uh, of course, sir!
Oh... well I'm... certain we can handle that too.
Oh... well, that's sounds nice actually. So you gonna play me a song?
Oh...I did not know you spoke his language.
Oh...I've killed three myself!
Oh?
Oh? How uncharacteristically prescient of you.
Oh? Then you better stay on my good side. 
Ohhh...
Ohhh... no.
Ok, Jedi! Fight me!
Okay good.
Okay maybe I exaggerated a little bit... sorry, but you know, I needed the job and it's not easy out there.
Okay okay. Let's do this.
Okay then, see ya at the clamps.
Okay then. 
Okay then...
Okay, BD. Calm down, I'll get it.
Okay, BD. Here we go.
Okay, BD. What is it?
Okay, I think they're dead. 
Okay, I trust you.
Okay, I'll look.
Okay, enough of this. Who are you really?
Okay, fine, you're right. It's just a blueprint on a datapad. But what can I say, BD. I'm a dreamer!
Okay, fine...
Okay, good. Hurry it up. I'll be right here where it's safe... If there is such a place.
Okay, ha ha.
Okay, he likes to play rough.
Okay, let's try this again.
Okay, look.
Okay, no problem. Let's get it.
Okay, okay, I don't do well in the cold. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. You probably would've won.
Okay, shut that thing off and grab some seat.
Okay, so next...
Okay, this is fine. Everything is gonna be fine.
Okay, uhh, throttle...
Okay, we gotta...
Okay, we'll keep looking.
Okay, well...
Okay, you got it.
Okay.
Okay. He's running away. 
Okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on!
Okay. I did it.
Okay. I just wanted to check first.
Okay. I think I need a minute.
Okay. I'll keep trying.
Okay. It's done.
Okay. Let's pick our next destination.
Okay. Let's push forward. 
Okay. Listen up. I only want to say this once. 
Okay. Now where?
Okay. Okay, I got this? I got this.
Okay. Okay. Just makin' sure, you know, I've heard some scary stories about Jedi.
Okay. Still in one piece.
Okay. That's new. 
Okay. Time to end this. 
Okay. What?
Okay... I definitely trust you.
Old Republic networks and independent systems were less secure of course. Now the Imperial network controls everything.
Old friend.
On him!
On him! Now!
On him.
On it!
On it.
On it. 
On it. Thanks.
On mission.
On my way!
On my way, Master Tapal.
On my way.
On my way. 
On our way to Zeffo. 
On second thought, she listens to their transmissions. Let her find out on her own.
On target. 
On task.
On task. 
On the Jedi's trail. 
On the enemy.
On the ground!
On the hunt for hostiles.
On the hunt. 
On the job.
On the mend.
On the move. 
On the ship. Indoors. I got walls. I got Jedi. I'm fine. Yeah... 
On this rock? Good luck.
On to the next one?
On you, Cal.
Once we liquidate the insurgent leaders, the others will fall in line.
Once we're inside I'll engage their defense level.
Once, but I left quickly. The energy inside... you will feel it.
Once, just once I'd like things to go smoothly. 
Once... I never felt so small. 
One Imperial transmission pinned him 'near a Wookiee village.' As if there aren't hundreds of those in the area.
One blow from their claws can snap your neck.
One down.
One down. 
One hit and you're gonna feel it. 
One less Imp!
One less Jedi. 
One less insurgent to deal with. 
One less problem.
One less thing to worry about...
One less.
One more day, one more kill.
One more to go.
One of many, but it's all connected.
One of my best clankers!
One of them might know how to contact Tarfful.
One of these days the Haxion Brood is going to catch up with you.
One way door.
One way out of here. Right through them.
One way out.
Only a few more shots. 
Only a matter of time before the target is acquired.
Only behind glass. Otherwise, nature's not a fan of me.
Only cowards run. 
Only death awaits you here.
Only one person believed in me. My old confidant, Jocasta Nu.
Only range remaining.
Only the weak run.
Only way is up.
Only we remain.
Only with a trusted connection will your memories be...
Oof, I can't believe I used to drink that stuff! It was the best night I'd had in years.
Oof. Hate to be that guy.
Ooh, a lightsaber. No, no, don't hide it.
Ooh, too bad.
Ooh...
Ooo! Those spikes. Ouch.
Ooo. Must have hurt!
Oooh, uglier then mating season on Yalbec Prime
Oops!
Open fire!
Opponent averting strikes.
Opponent discontinued.
Opponent fleeing conflict.
Opponent has high ground.
Opponent mending trauma.
Opponents life expectancy grave.
Opposition abolished.
Opposition errant.
Opposition groundward.
Opposition identified.
Or a droid.
Or displaced.
Or fight it.
Or maybe just bring me back something that will haunt me for the rest of my dreadful life? Any of that work... you weirdo?
Or maybe the Haxion Brood will come and find us.
Or maybe there's no need get it open quickly?
Or run fast.
Or suffer the same fate.
Or they could be stalling you on purpose. Stay wary.
Orders are orders.
Ostar... No!
Ouch. 
Our Brother falls!
Our artillery's down! We're in trouble!
Our back up is being killed.
Our backup is down. Repeat, backup down.
Our bond is eternal.
Our bounty's down there.
Our bounty's up there. 
Our brothers must fight for it.
Our brothers must fight to destroy. 
Our company will not quit.
Our droid's down!
Our duty is to secure all worlds for the Empire. To do that, we have to execute our orders to the letter.
Our efforts here are useful to the Empire.
Our enemy is agile. 
Our enemy is below!
Our enemy is below.
Our enemy is injured!
Our enemy is injured. 
Our enemy is up there. 
Our enemy is wounded!
Our enemy's weak!
Our flame support is down.
Our gunners are down! Try and form up. 
Our heavy artillery is eliminated.
Our heavy support is down.
Our holochess games. Cordova was so absorbed in his research I basically trained myself.
Our last flametrooper is down!
Our last flametrooper is down.
Our last gunner is down? We're in trouble. 
Our last gunner. 
Our last rocket unit is down! End this now!
Our last security droid.
Our mark!
Our mark's down there. 
Our mark's up there. 
Our mistakes...
Our new mission is to protect Auger at all costs.
Our next step's clear.
Our numbers dwindle. 
Our power grows with every day!
Our prey is here. And weak. 
Our ranged backup is down! 
Our ranged backup's gone.
Our ritual is complicated. It was difficult enough to teach myself to raise them.
Our service is what matters. We'll live on as long as the Empire reigns.
Our squad is out of flametroopers. 
Our suppression stormtroopers are down.
Our target is in pain. 
Our target is running.
Our target retreated.
Our target's in pain. 
Our village must be protected.
Out bounty's here. 
Out mark is below us. 
Out of artillery...
Out of backup, I don't know if I can handle this.
Out of droids.
Out of fighters, trying to handle it.
Out of heavy artillery!
Out of infantry backup. This won't be easy.
Out of juice. 
Out of my way. 
Out of nowhere, a syndicate ship intercepts our path - weapons charged up. 
Out of reach.
Out of rocket troops.
Out of the way!
Out of the way. 
Out there, I remembered something about myself from before the purge.
Outsider!
Outsider! Above us!
Outsider! Above!
Outsider. Above us. 
Outsider. Over there. 
Outstanding.
Outta the way!
Outwitted your powers.
Over here!
Over here! Could be supplies inside this walker!
Over here, BD!
Over here, Jedi.
Over here, Jedi. 
Over here.
Over here. Flame beetle.
Over so soon? 
Over there!
Over there! One of the cutters turned on. 
Overkill, don't you think?
Ow...
Padawan! Your lightsaber!
Padawan, something terrible is happening.
Padawan.
Padawan. It is time for instruction.
Padawan. Meet me at the gym for training.
Pah! He's running scared.
Pain is strength. 
Pain or exhaustion trick you.
Pain won't stop me.
Pardon us, Cal. We are in conversation.
Parried!
Parry notification.
Part of me wanted to believe he escaped.
Partly done. 
Pat it out!
Patched up.
Patching yourself up?
Pathetic excuse for a Jedi.
Pathetic!
Pathetic.
Pathetic. 
Patience. The hunt is equal to the kill.
Patrol to base. Got another breach down here, some kind of webbing. Hey, who's that? AHH!
Pay attention to your own blaster, rookie. 
Pay attention, Jedi!
Pay for the Jedi's sins!
Pay it no mind.
Perfect landing. Heh.
Perfect, buddy. 
Perfect. 
Perfect. Gotta be careful.
Perhaps if I... no that won't work.
Perhaps it's strange, but it is comforting to know I am not alone.
Perhaps my crawlers will tickle your fancy.
Perhaps this is the same ancient civilization which abounded there!
Perhaps you are right. The past holds much pain for both of us.
Perhaps you can show us your home, Greez.
Perhaps you've had some training after all.
Perhaps.
Perimeter is secure.
Perish, Jedi!
Perish. 
Persistence reveals the path.
Persistence through failure will reveal the path to greatness.
Pest eliminated.
Pest.
Pff. Easy credits. 
Phew! Can't believe we made it.
Phew! Close one.
Phew! Gave me a fright there, pal.
Phew! I needed that.
Phew! That was a close one.
Phew! Wasn't me.
Phillak approaching.
Phillak are medium sized fauna recognized for their surprising agility and speed.
Phillak here!
Phillak here! Don't let it charge you!
Phillak here.
Phillak here. Don't. Get. Hit.
Phillak inbound!
Phillak inbound.
Phillak over here.
Phillak! Here! Right here!
Phillak.
Phillak. Here.
Phillak? They're dangerous if they hit you but their eyesight is terrible.
Pick anywhere. Except Dathomir. Hate that place.
Picking our next destination? Follow your instincts.
Picking up a ship... following us.
Picking up anything? 
Pilot's gone!
Pin him down. Quick.
Pitiful.
Pity they are no more.
Pity. 
Pity. Heard about a high stakes game from one of Saw's fighters.
Pity. You would have made a fine apprentice. 
Plan on telling me where we're going?
Plan your path before you commit yourself.
Planning on cutting me in?
Plans to use aplexene to reinforce the hull of... the name's been redacted.
Plans to use the sap compound.
Plant your feet, Jedi!
Please be nothing. 
Please don't.
Please remain still.
Please stay down.
Please stay down. 
Please tell me nothing followed you home, kid. 
Please tell me we're leaving?
Please! Assist!
Please, do me a favor and hurry up at this place. It gives me the creeps. 
Please, help!
Please... I'm trying to collect my thoughts.
Plenty more recruits.
Plenty more where that came from.
Point taken.
Pointless acrobatics!
Pointless moves.
Pointless!
Pointless.
Poor Jedi...
Poor bogling was killed. Was it trying to defend its family?
Poor droids.
Poor technique!
Poor technique.
Positive impact.
Positive.
Possible anomaly. 
Possible insurgent. 
Possible intruder detected. 
Possible intruder identified. 
Possible intruder over there. 
Possible threat detected.
Possibly.
Potentially, but the target evaded them.
Power I control.
Power?
Practical guidance. Role models. Someone to look up to.
Prauf!
Prauf! You okay?!
Prauf, wait up.
Prauf, you alright?
Prauf.
Prauf. I'm sorry.
Prauf...
Prauf... a friend on Bracca. He sacrificed himself so I could live.
Prauf?
Predictable!
Predictable.
Prepare for defeat.
Prepare to be terminated.
Prepare to die, outsider.
Prepare yourself for death. 
Prepare yourself. Someone approaches.
Prepared to die, Jedi?
Preparing another attack. 
Press forward!
Press the attack! Get me down!
Press your attack!
Press your attack.
Pretty quick aren't ya?
Pretty quick aren't you?
Pretty quick. 
Pretty skilled aren't you. 
Pretty sure I've told you that before.
Pretty sure that was out last rocket unit. 
Pretty sure that's who he is.
Pretty weak for a Jedi. 
Primary function altered.
Priority target found! You're dead, Jedi!
Priority target! Fire!
Probably need to slice into this.
Probably nothing.
Probably outside trying to walk it off.

Right, if we cut the cables, the panels should shut down.
Right, that would be terrible.
Right, we can use their metal casings to our advantage.
Right, we're gonna need more than the wind to move that sphere.
Right. But if he gets away again, it's uh... not gonna be on us, right?
Right. No need to keep reminding me, though...
Right. Right. You doin' okay?
Right. Thank you, sir. I'm okay now. I'm ready. Following your lead.
Right. That's why...
Right. The winds control the sphere, so I need to open the right shafts.
Right...
Right... flank them from behind a rock?
Right... right... Good to know. I think...
Right... those smugglers tried to jump you at the Slag Pit.

Rule number two: without four arms to spare, stay outta the captain's chair.
Rumor has it someone put it there on purpose.
Rumors and speculation. 
Rumors in cantinas, but not much to go on.
Run all you want. 
Run all you want. We'll find you. 
Run for it!
Run on the wall, Cal.
Run while you can.
Run!
Run! You won't survive!
Run, Jedi. Run.

Save some? She's had like three or four servings already. 
Save what's left of him for scraps.
Saw Gerrera.
Saw a squad get overtaken by a group of scazz the other day. 
Saw managed to take one out in the escape.
Saw may have known what he could and couldn't accomplish. He's been fighting the Empire for a long time. 
Saw retreated off-world.
Saw should be at the other end of this trench.
Saw's goals may not be the same as ours. We should be careful.
Saw's plan?
Saw's seen us through worse.
Saw's up ahead.
Saw's up ahead. We must be close.

Scanners failing...
Scanning again?
Scanning lower levels for the enemy. 
Scanning the perimeter.
Scanning.
Scare me everytime with that. 
Scared of a getting hit?
Scared of a little blaster burn?
Scared of a little pain?
Scared of getting burned?
Scared, Jedi?
Scared, are we?
Scared?
Scazz approaching! 
Scazz are typically slow above ground, but gain speed and distance when burrowing underground.
Scazz here!
Scazz here?
Scazz!
Scazz! Right here!
Scazz! Watch the ground!
Scazz! Watch your feet!
Scazz! We got a scazz! Right here!

Scum!
Scurry all you like, rat!
Search everywhere. He can't have gone far.
Searching for enemy. 
Searching for threats is a waste of our time.
Searching. 
Second's gonna love this.
Secure the perimeter.
Security droid is down. I'll try and step up. 
Security droids down.
Security units fallen.
See 'em? Empire isn't the only thing we have to worry about.
See anywhere to tie the window's rope off?
See something in there?
See that funnel cloud over there?
See that structure over there?
See that, BD? Haxion Brood.
See you again soon!
See you there, pal.
See! They come for us all!
See, now you're getting it, kid. I'm glad we had this little chat. 
Seek out the hidden tombs of the Three Sages.
Seems excessive.
Seems like Saw's willing to do whatever it takes.
Seems like it.
Seems like these spheres are related to the sockets on the ground. What do you think, BD?
Seems like we've been walking into a lot of them.
Seems like you're hurt.
Seems we made the Empire nervous. They're stepping up security on Zeffo and Kashyyyk.
Seized threat.
Send more!
Senseless slaughter. 
Senseless!
Seriously.
Seriously?
Seriously? Where'd he go?
Set a course for Bogano.
Setting course for...wait you wanna go to Dathomir?!
Shall I end this?
Shall I kill you now or torture you first?
Shame - that guy could take a hit, give 'em back and still knock back a Bloody Rancor.
She betrayed me.
She claims she plays a musical instrument.
She could go home.
She cut herself off from the Force.
She did. I'm on my way.
She didn't make it, Greez.
She entrusted me with a holocron from the Jedi Archives - a  secret copy of her list of young Force-sensitives.
She had to watch her whole family perish.
She has a holocron.
She has a knack for this kind of stuff.
She is the only person I know as brave as you, BD-1.
She likes her souvenirs but...
She made note of all the best foods she could cook, but in the end it was either you needed heat or you didn't,
She may no longer be a Jedi, but she'll never stop fighting for what she believes in.
She must have learned a lot from you. 
She said that too. Very wise lady.
She seemed so sure there was no point in trying to fight the Empire.
She stayed behind with the Younglings.
She told me you betrayed her to the Empire.
She told me...
She turned.
She used... the dark side.
She was an Inquisitor.
She was hoping to use it to gain favor with the Emperor, but her deception was making her reckless.
She was my apprentice.
She was only a child...
She was the best. Besides her, never really had much of a family.
She was weak.
She will join us or die...
She will not stop until she destroys you.
She won't. And we will be.
She won't. You'll be alright. 
She'll say anything to jeopardize this mission.
She'll sell you out too.
She's a Force user hunting Jedi survivors.
She's alright. She's alright.
She's down there.
She's got you there.
She's in no condition to fight.
She's over there.
She's right, Cal. Safe places are slim to none at this point. We must succeed or it'll only get worse. 
She's right.
She's safe.
She's stronger than that.
She's up there.
She's with us, you know.
Shelter when I was weak. Enlightenment when I was lost in the dark.
Shh, take notice.
Shh. Quiet! You'll wake up my plants.
Shhh... we don't know if it's friendly.
Shield up. 
Shield up. Charging. 
Shifting to solely ranged tactics. 
Shock 'em!
Shock that one!
Shock this thing, it deserves it. 
Shoot and move.
Shoot at him!
Shoot him down!
Shoot him or something. 
Shoot him!
Shoot now!
Shoot that Jedi!
Shoot the enemy!
Shoot the target!
Shoot. Him. 
Shooters wiped out.
Shooting Jedi.
Shooting at the target. 
Should I be worried about the bounties?
Should be a lot quicker than the way in.
Should be safe here.
Should we move up?
Should we tell him?
Should've listened to BD-1!
Shouldn't be much of a fight.
Shouldn't have come here. 
Shouldn't have tried to play the hero.
Shouldn't we stick together?
Shouldn't you be saving the galaxy? That is what Jedi do, no?
Shove it!
Shove off!
Show me what  you are truly capable of!
Show me what you have learned!
Show me your famous Jedi skills. 
Show me your skill!
Show me your strength!
Show off.
Show some professional bearing, trooper. 
Show your face!
Show yourself!
Show yourself! Now!
Show yourself, Jedi.
Show yourself, lowlife.
Show yourself.
Show yourself. 
Showoff.
Silence! I know!
Simple and direct.
Simple dodge.
Since when do you care about art?
Sir, I feel my position at this outpost is wasted. My skill could be used elsewhere.
Sir, I heard a rumor that an item retrieved by the Second Sister
Sir, I've seen your combat skills. They are impressive. How often do you train?
Sir, all due respect. I want Jedi combat not Wookiee.
Sir, do you have any advice on fighting the Jedi?
Sir, excuse me. I wanted to mention that if there is anything you need, I'm ready.
Sir, how do you stay motivated?
Sir, if I may.
Sir, if the escaped Wookiees return, how will we defeat them? Especially with a Jedi on their side.
Sir, if you don't mind me asking, did you fight in the Clone Wars?
Sir, is it true that the Jedi may be traveling with a Latero criminal?
Sir, once operations here are underway, I would appreciate a recommendation to remain.
Sir, uh, permission to speak freely?
Sir, you may have heard that my boots aren't the correct size. My old ones got damaged by a flame beetle...
Sir.
Sir?
Sister Merrin.
Sisters.
Sisters...
Sit down, kid. It's time to land. 
Six seeds enough for you, Greez?
Skilled...
Skillful response. 
Skulking in the shadows with a betrayer.
Skungus are sentient flora on zeffo that are filled with explosive material which combust on contact.
Skungus. Sentient plant. Filled with explosives. This describes them as jumpy?
Slice 'em!
Slice damage repaired.
Slice in! Quick!
Slice into that Imperial droid!
Slice into that droid!
Slice it!
Slice that droid!
Slice that security droid!
Slice the droid! Quick!
Slice the security droid!
Slice their system and depressurize the wing. 
Slice this KX droid!
Slicing encrypted transmissions was always a pastime of hers. She taught me once.
Slight damage.
Slipped up a little that time.
Slipped up. 
Slippery!
Sloppy!
Sloppy.
Slow goin'?
Slow his saber!
Slow, as always.
Slow. 
Slowing down is one thing, but what we're doing will end them for good.
Sluggish!
Sluggish.
Slyyyg approaching.
Slyyyg approaching. 
Slyyyg are large, carnivorous gastropods that hang from trees.
Slyyyg here.
Slyyyg over here.
Slyyyg!
Slyyyg! Here!
Slyyyg! Kill it!
Slyyyg! Over here!
Slyyyg.
Slyyyg. Here.
Slyyyg. Right here.
Smart move would be high ground.
Smells good Greez.
Snatching attacker.
Sneaking around down there, Jedi?
Sneaky beasts are too fast for my weapon.
Snuffed out the flame support.
So - looks like Sorc Tormo really wants a piece of you.
So I'm all you've got.
So I...
So afraid, aren't you?
So am I but...we didn't really have a choice, did we?
So are you.
So cocky.
So defensive.
So far I've managed to deflect their sensors, but we're not in a defensible position. 
So far so good.
So far. Almost to the prison.
So fast!
So fragile...
So here's my advice: the Empire's overtaken hundreds of worlds. There's a reason Saw chose Kashyyyk.
So if I can get out of the way I'll be fine?
So if it happens again, I'll throw the culprit off the ship myself.
So if we can't kill one it won't be my fault. Got it.
So impressed.
So impressive, Jedi!
So it's not a bad idea to learn from the past. Alright enough free wisdom from me. I'm tired and hungry.
So kid, heard you outran some fancy looking TIE. Not a ship I'd wanna run into outside the Mantis.
So let's make this quick.
So many crawlers make me uneasy.
So many different cultures in the Galaxy and each one had their own unique works of art.
So many lives lost. How could the Order have been so blind to the danger?
So much fear and rage. How could anyone survive here?
So much fear.
So much hatred...
So much mystery and potential - and it wasn't even open yet. 
So much to see...
So next, maybe...
So nimble.
So now what?
So quick!
So quick...
So slow...
So sure, are you?
So that fires the cannons.
So that's the blasters. 
So there I am: fifty meters over this thing. They're on the comm yelling, about to open fire.
So there we were, just a simple trip to the market for some milk...or so we thought!
So there's something there...
So they are mining this planet to desecrate Jedi culture?
So those are the blasters...
So we made our move.
So weak you rely on a droid?
So what did you find?
So what did you train on?
So what was in there?
So what's your count at?
So what's your plan?
So what?
So where to now?
So you and Cere have been here a few times.
So you can jump high?
So you finally found it?
So you knew about BD-1?
So you say... Cal.
So you're not chilly?
So you're skilled in fencing.
So you've said.
So, Cere, you never mentioned why you hired me and not some other pilot.
So, be honest. You upset that droid chose the kid over you?
So, how'd you get here?
So, if the Order thing is rebuilt, you think any Jedi will come out of hiding?
So, kinda like you.
So, next let's go to...
So, that's why we have to go around and kill every last one of them. Right?
So, the jotaz. Local fauna. Incredibly strong and durable.
So, who are you looking for?
So, y'know, get out there and get me some seeds.
So, you dig up any ancient Zeffonian treasures?
So, you know, I get it. 
So...
So... how are you holding up?
So... you need somethin'?
So...?
So?
Solid contact!
Solid contact. 
Solid copy.
Solid copy. 
Solid technique...
Solid.
Some Jedi trick. 
Some Jedi trick?
Some Jedi!
Some Jedi, huh?
Some Jedi. 
Some disturbance. 
Some help here, BD-1?
Some help please.
Some kind of curse on it.
Some kind of trick...
Some kind of trick?
Some may be far-fetched, but from what I've seen on this trip... I just hope it all works out, kid.
Some may believe so. I know Cal and Cere do.
Some noise there. 
Some of them are kinda my fault...
Some of us have joined the Wookiee fighters in the forests.
Some skill!
Some sort of spirit that certain force wielders could manipulate.
Some things - people, events, or experiences - leave an echo in the Force that I can connect to. 
Some things might be worth knowing.
Somebody shoot him!
Someone I killed, perhaps?
Someone ahead. 
Someone doesn't want to die today. 
Someone else attack him!
Someone else get in here.
Someone else get up here!
Someone else kill this weakling. 
Someone else take him down!
Someone else take him. 
Someone else want a turn?
Someone get a shot. 
Someone get eyes on him before he's gone. 
Someone get him!
Someone get him. 
Someone get on him. 
Someone give me a hand!
Someone has to stand up to the Empire. Why not us?
Someone help!!
Someone hid here, from clones. They were under attack.
Someone kill it.
Someone kill this kid for me!
Someone kill this thing - it's not worth my time. 
Someone made camp here. They were excited to discover a giant creature that lives close by... A Binog, they called it.
Someone making the Empire angry.
Someone might be back there. 
Someone needs a break. 
Someone needs to stop him!
Someone over there?
Someone should catch him!
Someone should survive. Might as well be me.
Someone stop him from recovering. 
Someone stop him!
Someone there?
Someone up there?
Someone was drawn to something here... energy, from the ruins?
Someone was here... An outsider, not from this planet. 
Someone was hunted here.
Someone who just brought an AT-AT to the table. Who are you?
Someone will take you out. 
Someone! Anyone!
Someone! Anyone! Help!
Someone! Get him!
Someone! Get over here!
Someone! Kill him!
Someone! Please! Help!
Someone! Put it out!
Someone! The Jedi!
Someone's closing in on us.
Someone's down there!
Someone's down there?
Someone's here.
Someone's here. 
Someone's here...
Someone's in here!
Someone's in the maintenance halls!
Someone's low on funds.
Someone's nervous. 
Someone's over there. 
Someone's over there? 
Someone's really hurt!
Someone's testy.
Someone's there.
Someone's too scared. 
Someone's unsteady. 
Someone. There. 
Someone? Help?
Something about one of our walkers being hijacked on Kashyyyk...
Something about that wall...
Something about this doesn't feel right. The Empire doesn't give ground.
Something about this place... It's sacred to them.
Something around here must raise this lantern.
Something back there.
Something back there. 
Something better.
Something catch your eye?
Something cool?
Something dark transpired here - I can feel it.
Something happened and I... just can't.
Something happened to me during the Purge.
Something interesting?
Something is close. Find it.
Something is here. 
Something is... wrong...
Something isn't right, I'll check it out.
Something making noise?
Something moves. 
Something moving over there. 
Something over there. 
Something over there...
Something smells like old oil.
Something smells... ooof.
Something smells... what is that?
Something strange... 
Something tells me coming here was a poor life choice.
Something terrible happened here... a massacre. They killed their own kind, for promises about power.
Something terrible.
Something there. 
Something there...
Something there?
Something we can use?
Something wrong with that creature.
Something's here.
Something's nearby.
Something's not right.
Something's not right...
Something's over here.
Something's over there. 
Something's over there...
Something's wrong. We need to get back.
Sometimes I still wonder how it happened.
Sometimes I'll be focused so much on braising a Shaak Roast that I barely even notice that my apron is completely on fire.
Sometimes the exhaust valve needs a bit of tending to, but otherwise, it hasn't been much of an issue.
Sometimes the journey is dangerous. Tensions are high. Everyone feels it. I've seen it in Padawans and elder Jedi alike.
Sometimes you creep me out, kid.
Soon they will be completely eradicated and those who aren't, will be hunted and tortured to death.
Soon this planet will be ours. 
Sorc says hello.
Sorc's gonna be pleased.
Sorry
Sorry about that.
Sorry, Cal!
Sorry, I didn't mean to... Yes. I agree. Our position is honorable. Thank you, sir.
Sorry, buddy. Not you.
Sorry, but I didn't.
Sorry.
Sorry. 
Sorry. I didn't get much sleep last night. 
Sorry...

Staunch the flow. It will return. 
Stay alert!
Stay alert.
Stay alert. He'll be back. 
Stay alert... we may have action!
Stay alive down there?
Stay alive out there.
Stay at your post and shoot to kill.
Stay aware of his movements!
Stay away!
Stay back!
Stay back! Jotaz!
Stay back! Just... stay back!
Stay back, Jedi!
Stay calm!
Stay calm. Find the intruder. 
Stay calm. We don't need droids. 
Stay calm. We've lost a flametrooper. 
Stay close, BD! Those things look fast.
Stay down!
Stay in formation.
Stay low, buddy!
Stay observant. 
Stay on guard. 
Stay on guard. For some reason, this planet is an asset to the Empire. We must protect it.
Stay on him. 
Stay on task, Padawan.
Stay out of that things way!
Stay out of their way.
Stay right there.
Stay safe, Cal. Kashyyyk is still dangerous. 
Stay steady!
Stay still!
Stay strong until we get back.
Stay strong, Brothers. 
Stay vigilant, scazz can emerge from any dirt or other soft ground surfaces. 
Stay wary Brothers. 
Stay with him. 
Stay with the Younglings, Trilla.
Stay, Brother. This is mine. 
Staying safe back there?
Steady yourselves.
Steady!
Steady! Concentrate fire!
Steady, Brothers. 
Steady. 
Steel yourselves!
Step back!
Step back, I've got this.
Step forward for identification. 
Step forward. Identify yourself. 
Step off.
Step on up!
Step up.
Stick with Cal, BD-1. It may not seem like it, but he could use the company.
Stifled by tradition.
Still afraid to fight?
Still alive in there?
Still back there?
Still here.
Still incompetent!
Still need to fix your scomp link.
Still not sure what I'm supposed to find. He's a little...
Still not threatened.
Still resisting?
Still resisting? Unwise.
Still running?
Still standing after all this time. Makes you wonder what our legacy will be.
Still standing, eh?
Still taking you down. 
Still, there's gotta be a stealthier way in.
Still... it's unacceptable.
Still...it feels good to tear this place apart.
Stim here!
Stim here, BD.
Stim here, buddy!
Stim here, please.
Stim please, buddy.
Stim please?
Stim time!
Stim!
Stim! Here!
Stim! Now!
Stim, BD!
Stim, BD-1!
Stim, BD?
Stim, please!
Stim?
Stims will not save you. 
Stims won't save you.
Stims...
Stims? Really?
Stop blocking and fight!
Stop complaining, stormtrooper. Focus on your duties.
Stop cowering and fight. 
Stop creeping around my ship, kid.
Stop dancing around!
Stop deflecting and fight!
Stop dodging and fight!
Stop dragging your feet.
Stop flipping and fight. 
Stop hiding and fight!
Stop hiding down there. 
Stop hiding!
Stop hiding. 
Stop him already!
Stop him from moving!
Stop him from recovering!
Stop him!
Stop him! 
Stop him! Before he's gone!
Stop him! Now!
Stop him! That was our last rocket unit!
Stop him.
Stop him. 
Stop him. Quick. 
Stop his recovery!
Stop his recovery. 
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it now!
Stop letting him use stims!
Stop messing around.
Stop moving and fight. 
Stop moving!
Stop moving.
Stop now!
Stop playing around! You must push yourself to the limit!
Stop playing games!
Stop playing games, Jedi!
Stop prolonging your fate. 
Stop resisting!
Stop resisting. 
Stop right there.
Stop runnin'!
Stop running and fight!
Stop running and get up here. 
Stop running away!
Stop running so much!
Stop running!
Stop running, intruder!
Stop running, you coward!
Stop skulking around down there. 
Stop slipping away!
Stop sneaking around and come out. 
Stop sneaking around down there. 
Stop stalling and fight. 
Stop stalling!
Stop that. 
Stop the Jedi!
Stop the Jedi. 
Stop the intruder!
Stop the intruder. 
Stop these games!
Stop these tricks. 
Stop this enchantment!
Stop this foolishness!
Stop this foolishness.
Stop this nonsense, trespasser. 
Stop this now. 
Stop this trickery!
Stop this!
Stop this! Stop it Jedi!
Stop this, Jedi!
Stop this, Jedi. 
Stop this, padawan.
Stop this. 
Stop trying to flee.
Stop trying to get away!
Stop using tricks. 
Stop wasting my time!
Stop with the games, Jedi.
Stop with the trickery, Jedi.
Stop your worrying. We're not the ones in trouble. 
Stop!
Stop! Come here!
Stop, Jedi!
Stop, intruder!
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop.
Stop. 
Stop. This. 
Storm worrying you?
Storm's over. 
Stormtrooper KIA. 
Stormtrooper down!
Stormtrooper down. Repeat, stormtrooper down. 
Stormtrooper! Get a hold of yourself. I heard nothing - you heard nothing. Stay in position and be ready.
Stormtrooper, do you know your orders?
Stormtrooper, get to the point.
Stormtrooper, keep focus. If you spot the traitor, remember your training. The Empire is depending on us. 
Stormtrooper. Keep an eye out for the large, insect-like creatures.
Stormtrooper. Schedule for returning to basecamp?
Stormtroopers and workers. Expendable resources.
Stormtroopers...
Strange for such a culture to have any sort of fascination with a place so... dark.
Strange that an order of peacekeepers bond around creating weapons.
Strange that the Jedi would be so interested in our operation here.
Strange...
Strike him quickly. 
Strike him!
Strike me again!
Strike me down!
Strike me, coward!
Strike now.
Strike restrained.
Strike true or perish!
Strike true!
Strike true, Brothers. 
Striking target. 
Strong with the dark side.
Strong words, coming from you.
Structure is already damaged.
Studying the nature of...
Stumble, is that it?
Stun 'em!
Stupid beasts!
Stupid creature!
Stupid, big teeth. And all that hair, what's up with that?
Stuta karkina tonta! Bwa-hahaaha! Tonta!
Submit!
Success and failure, life and death, light and dark. What divides them is your state of mind.
Succumb to your wounds.
Such beautiful brutality. 
Such carnage!
Such desperation... he, too, knows you are lost.
Such ferocious skill. 
Such finesse...
Such hatred.
Such poor aim.
Such poor performance.
Such skill!
Such spectacle!
Such speed!
Sudden movement unforeseen.
Suffer as I have.
Suffer, Jedi!
Suit yourself. I won't be long.
Sure but don't they usually have plants in them?
Sure is. In fact, it's a bit harder being a plant.
Sure it's worth the cost? I hear Project Auger came at a high price.
Sure thing, Prauf.
Sure thing.
Sure thing. It's a great feeling. 
Sure, Greez. Whatever you say.
Sure, sure. That's, that's true. But I still believe in what I bet and I'm letting it ride with you, Cal.
Sure, that too. But not anymore. I promise. Not for awhile, at least.
Sure, with a little help from great-grandma. And when this is all over, I'm opening up Greezy's Cooking Academy.
Sure.
Sure. I understand. It's your weapon. I wouldn't want to give mine away either, but if you change your mind...
Sure. Sure. If I held that thing, I-I might lose an arm.
Sure. Sure. That's fine, but if you do change your mind, my great-grandmother made a mean stew back on Lateron.
Surprisingly clever. 
Surrender now and we may spare the youngest...
Surrender now. 
Surrender the holocron.
Surrender!
Surrender, intruder. 
Surrender. 
Surrender. You cannot win against our numbers.
Surrendered the location of her naive Padawan.
Surround him and attack.
Surround him!
Surround him. 
Surveyed opponents' position.
Surviving Jedi had to go into hiding. Bracca was the safest place for me... I guess.
Survivors.
Swarms.
Switch to close combat tactics.
Switch to ranged tactics.
System breach detected.
System malfunction.

T-take this!
THE Empire. The one bent on exterminating Force-sensitives so no one can stand against it?
Tackling the Jedi. 
Tagging enemy.
Take 'em down!
Take 'em down, BD!
Take 'em out!
Take a shot at him. 
Take care of each other.
Take care on your journey, traveler.
Take cover!
Take evasive action!
Take her and go. I'll lead them away. 
Take him brothers. 
Take him down!
Take him far too long to cut through these doors with that lightsaber.
Take him out already!
Take him out!
Take him out! Then we go after Tapal.
Take it down!
Take it out!
Take it out.
Take it!
Take position.
Take that beast down.
Take that one out!
Take that!
Take that, Jedi!
Take that, Malicos!
Take the beetle out.
Take the creature out.
Take the shot!
Take this!
Take this, Jedi!
Take this, Jedi. 
Take this.
Take this. 
Take you wherever you gotta go.
Take your blows!
Take your stims. It will not stop me. 
Takin' 'em down!
Taking a break from placing a few bets?
Taking a break?
Taking a breather, Jedi?
Taking a breather. 
Taking a breather?
Taking a long break, Cal. It's a struggle, but I'm dealing with it.
Taking a look.
Taking a step back. 
Taking aim!
Taking aim. 
Taking down the intruder. 
Taking fire!
Taking him down!
Taking him down.
Taking it down.
Taking off!
Taking stims won't help. 
Taking the shot!
Taking the shot.
Taking the shot. 
Tally rising.
Tapal's on the move.
Tarfful could be anywhere! Like deep in the ground, like we're gonna be if we get caught up in that battle down there.
Tarfful could be with them.
Tarfful couldn't risk more warriors to save him. He spent months in that refinery.
Tarfful is impossible to find.
Tarfful my old friend, I understand now. This tree connects the core of the planet to the sky.

Taron Malicos might have been part of my Order but what he is now, I...
Taron Malicos.
Taron Malicos... I thought that name sounded familiar. He was one of the Jedi's most trusted generals.
Taste pain!
Tay'lori olee-ay!
Tch!
Tch! All rocket troopers down!
Tch! Futile.
Tch! Jedi reflexes.
Tch! The droid's were incompetent anyway.
Tch. A lucky catch.
Tch. Stims. 
Technically, this whole system is Imperial property.
Tee bee doo!
Tell me, Jedi, how did your Master look when he died?
Tell me, where did he hide the holocron?
Tell that droid to stop looking at me.
Tell that to him. He can understand you.
Tell us, Cal.
Tells a different tale.
Terminated target.
Termination imminent.
Termination postponed. 
Termination protocol: ceased
Than just surviving.
Thank you for helping me with Malicos. Thought I was a goner for a minute.
Thank you for helping, BD-1.
Thank you for standing with us.
Thank you for your support, sir. Now let's go kill some Jedi.
Thank you much, little one. We'll wait for Saw's signal.
Thank you, Greez.
Thank you, Saw.
Thank you, buddy.
Thank you, sir. It was an honor and it still is. 
Thank you.
Thank you. 
Thank you. All of you.
Thank you. Goodbye, my friend.
Thank you. There's Stormtroopers everywhere.
Thank you. What will you all do now?
Thanks BD.
Thanks Greez, you shouldn't have.
Thanks for all the aid, buddy.
Thanks for being here, BD.
Thanks for being my friend.
Thanks for the help back there, BD. You saved my life.
Thanks for the help, BD.
Thanks for the help, buddy.
Thanks for the help.
Thanks for the help. 
Thanks for the stims, buddy.
Thanks for what you said, Cere.
Thanks for your help.
Thanks so much, buddy.
Thanks!
Thanks! Hope this new encryption keeps her out for good.
Thanks, BD-1.
Thanks, BD.
Thanks, BD. 
Thanks, BD. That was close.
Thanks, Cere.
Thanks, bud.
Thanks, buddy.
Thanks, buddy. 
Thanks, buddy. It's nice to know I'm not alone.
Thanks, kid.
Thanks, kid. You're alright.
Thanks, little droid.
Thanks.
Thanks. 
Thanks. I'll be back as soon as I've got my crystal.
Thanks. I'll be fine.
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.
Thanks. I'll try to get you a win.
Thanks. Let's just get outta here.
Thanks. Not bad yourself. 
Thanks. So are you.
Thanks. We're ready. The both of us.
Thanks... for everything. 
That I can agree with. I've seen trash heaps before...
That I don't know what's good for me?
That Jedi will pay for what he did to the Ninth Sister.
That almost killed 'em!
That broken lightsaber...
That could have gone better...
That could stop it. But you might miss.
That creature seems so at home here.
That crystal magnifies heat from the light outside.
That did it.
That did nothing.
That did something.
That did the trick!
That didn't feel so great...
That didn't go to plan...
That does the trick. 
That doesn't look good.
That doesn't mean we can't be prepared, Cal.
That doesn't mean you didn't save lives.
That doesn't scare me!
That doesn't scare me.
That droid cannot save you.
That droid had family, ya know.
That droid seems to like you.
That droid was a killer.
That feels better.
That fight wasn't nearly long enough. 
That helps. 
That hit the spot.
That hurt.
That hurt? 
That hurts.
That is BD-1.
That is how you do it.
That is my intent. Dathomir and my Nightsisters will have to wait.
That is not the way.
That is nothing.
That is odd. Keep an eye out.
That is the only way to succeed. Don't allow yourself to be weighed down by ego and pretense. 
That is what this planet used to be.
That it? Oh well.
That just takes all the fun out of it.
That looks different.
That looks like a problem.
That makes one person.
That might be a good thing.
That must be the one who tortured Cere.
That musta hurt.
That one is stronger than he realizes.
That one there!
That one!
That one's down!
That place is a death trap. We should just never go there, right Cal?
That refinery was Imperial property!
That reminds me. When was the last time we sent a full report back to Coruscant?
That saber won't save you.
That section looks pretty weak.
That ship...
That should still be enough to stomp out these insurgents. Keep us steady!
That so...?
That song...
That sounds a little dangerous, bud.
That sounds like a goal I can get behind.
That still okay with you?
That stormtrooper isn't getting up. 
That stormtrooper... he's dead!
That strike will be your last.
That the Emperor is interested in Zeffo? Maybe.
That thing looks like it smells worse than Greez does.
That thing looks like trouble.
That thing probably isn't friendly.
That tomb that we spoke in before, it was built by an ancient culture. The Zeffo.
That traitor won't get away with that here.
That trick only works if they're not expecting it. I have another idea.
That was a big mistake. 
That was a close one, kid! Aren't you supposed to be watching the monitors?
That was a close one.
That was a tough fight.
That was almost the end...
That was close.
That was fun.
That was fun. What's next?
That was good, Greez. Very good.
That was great. 
That was kind of rough.
That was luck.
That was my baby...
That was my highest earner.
That was nothing.
That was nothing. Just wait!
That was one of my favorites.
That was our droid...
That was our final ranged trooper!
That was our last droid!
That was our last droid. This is a little dicey. 
That was our last flamethrower unit. 
That was our last flametrooper!
That was our last flametrooper! Stop him!
That was our last flametrooper.
That was our last gunner!
That was our last gunner! Watch your back!
That was our last gunner.
That was our last gunner. Attempting to change tactics. 
That was our last gunner. Change formation. 
That was our last ranged trooper!
That was our last ranged trooper. Move up. 
That was our last rocket trooper!
That was our last rocket trooper. Trying to change position. 
That was our last rocket trooper...
That was our last rocket unit. 
That was our last rocket unit. Move up. 
That was our last rocket unit? We're in trouble.  
That was our last security droid!
That was out last gunner!
That was out last gunner. Keep steady. 
That was out last heavy gunner.
That was quick. 
That was quick...
That was sloppy.
That was something else. 
That was the last melee unit in this sector. 
That was the last of our flametroopers!
That was the last rocket trooper.
That was the last rocket unit in the squadron. 
That was the last rocket unit!
That was you in the water, wasn't it?
That was... almost enjoyable.
That was... not tough at all.
That was... way too close. 
That was...impressive. How are you holding up?
That wasn't just any clanker.
That wasn't so easy, huh?
That wasn't so hard.
That way no one can rival his power.
That we could move on.
That went too quickly. 
That will sting.
That won't change anything.
That won't deter me.
That won't help you with me.
That won't stop us.
That won't work.
That would be unwise considering the potential for significant scientific findings.
That would explain your survival.
That you're strong enough to embrace your emotions. Give yourself time. 
That! Is enough!
That'd be a breach of protocol. If there's a disturbance, their squad should call it in.
That'll have to do. Go!
That'll hurt!
That's a Brawler Droid processing unit.
That's a Stormtrooper.
That's a blow to morale.
That's a game term.
That's a hell of a plan.
That's a hit!
That's a kill.
That's a lotta lasers.
That's a lucrehulk.
That's a really big bug.
That's a slyyyg?
That's a stim!
That's a stormtrooper down!
That's a stormtrooper down. 
That's a stormtrooper down...
That's all I can ask, thank you. 
That's all done.
That's all you were doing, huh?
That's an ally down.
That's an excellent find. It will need my personal evaluation.
That's another ally down!
That's because for a brief moment I forgot where we were, but thank you so much for reminding me, Cal.
That's because they've been aided by Jedi traitors.
That's better!
That's better. Thanks, BD-1.
That's different.
That's enough!
That's enough! On the ground. 
That's enough, Jedi!
That's enough. Jedi.
That's enough. Let's get back to it.
That's everything the Jedi stood against.
That's fancy. 
That's gonna leave a mark. 
That's gonna sting later.
That's good for us, but the caves will be crawling with them.
That's good, buddy.
That's good.
That's good. You're learning to embrace the Force again.
That's gratitude for ya.
That's handled.
That's how it's done. 
That's how we take him out. 
That's how you do it. 
That's how you prepare for death. Rest when you're dead, stormtrooper.
That's inhuman...
That's interesting.
That's interesting. We're on the right track.
That's it for him.
That's it for our droid...
That's it for our flametrooper support!
That's it for our flametroopers. 
That's it for our gunner support.
That's it for our heavy artillery support.
That's it for our ranged troopers.
That's it for our rocket troopers.
That's it for you!
That's it! I can see it shining.
That's it! We're out of droids!
That's it, got no more ranged trooper backup!
That's it. He's down. 
That's it. We're out of droids. 
That's it... its all over now.
That's kind of you to say, Cal, but I won't be in the Vault with you.
That's not an easy maneuver.
That's not doing anything.
That's not gonna save you. 
That's not gonna work.
That's not good.
That's not good...
That's not moving.
That's not opening.
That's not possible!
That's not possible...
That's not proper blaster handling procedure. 
That's not what walls are for.
That's not working.
That's nothin'!
That's nothin'.
That's nothing.
That's nothing. 
That's okay. It'll all work out. That's what my great-grandma used to say.
That's okay. You've got enough to spare.
That's one down...
That's one for me.
That's one less to worry about.
That's one of the reasons I took her on as my Padawan.  
That's one possibility.
That's one way to do it. 
That's one way to end it. 
That's our droid support down. 
That's our last KX droid. 
That's our last KX unit.
That's our last droid down. 
That's our last droid. Move up. 
That's our last droid...
That's our last flame unit.
That's our last flametrooper!
That's our last gunner.
That's our last heavy gunner!
That's our last ranged trooper.
That's our last ranged trooper. 
That's our last rocket trooper.
That's our last rocket trooper. 
That's our last rocket trooper...
That's our last suppression unit. 
That's out of the way. 
That's over.
That's part of his charm.
That's probably not good.
That's reassuring?
That's right.
That's right. I know I've seen sliceable doors around here.
That's right. On your knees.
That's so much better.
That's someone over there, right?
That's strange. 
That's surprising.
That's the Jedi!
That's the Vault Cere mentioned. Whoever I'm supposed to find must be waiting there.
That's the bridge into their village.
That's the challenge I'm hoping for. It makes the reward sweeter. 
That's the end of our ranged support!
That's the end of that.
That's the idea.
That's the last droid in our sector. 
That's the last of our artillery!
That's the last of our droids!
That's the last of our ranged support.
That's the last of our ranged trooper support!
That's the last of our ranged unit. Now it's my turn. 
That's the last of our rocket troopers.
That's the last of the droid support. 
That's the last of them.
That's the last rocket trooper...
That's the path to the Shadowlands? There has to be a way across.
That's the plan. We don't know their endgame but they've spread themselves too thin. This map we've recovered proves it.
That's the thing that took down the Ninth Sister.
That's the way we came.
That's the way? Alright.
That's their mandate.
That's too close!
That's too high.
That's true.
That's true. I don't know what's more dangerous: the Empire or an angry bog rat.
That's true. I guess we'll have to settle for command positions. 
That's what Cere said, but she also said it's full of deadly creatures, so I'll be inside for now.
That's what I said, Jedi. It's not about right or wrong, it's about life or death.
That's what happens when you don't follow protocol.
That's what he gets for not following patrol procedures. 
That's what the Empire is all about. Taming the galaxy. Bringing it to order.
That's what they said about Bracca.
That's what they said on Kashyyyk and look how that turned out.
That's what we're here for. Make the Empire proud, stormtrooper.
That's where Cere and Greez are waiting for me.
That's where I learned how to play Sabacc.
That's where we met.
That's where we need to go. I can feel it.
That's where we're supposed to meet Tarfful.
That's why we need the Jedi. 
That's wonderful news!
That's your call, Cal. I'm sure it'll make Greez happy... I bet he's still hiding on the ship.
That's... better.
That's... hard to hear. Regardless, a vessel like that, carrying one of our own...
That's... that's not possible.
That's... unexpected. 
That... was me. 
The AT-ST?
The Astrium.
The Bogano Vault - constructed by the Zeffo millennia ago - granted me a vision of the Jedi's doom.
The Brood always wins. 
The Brood just won't give up.
The Brood kind of botched up my clean record with Cere... well, semi-clean. So, no. Not leavin' just yet.
The Brood says hello. 
The Brood will always find you. 
The Brood! Get ready for a fight, BD.
The Clone Wars took my sister from me. I've fought in her name ever since.
The Eedit Temple on Devaron. The light was so strong there, you could feel it all around you.
The Emperor prevails!
The Emperor's propaganda machine spews out lies so fast that people can't recognize the truth.
The Emperor. So I'd watch your tone.
The Empire can't take our compassion.
The Empire doesn't know this place exists?
The Empire doesn't make mistakes, stormtrooper.
The Empire forced the villagers from their homes. Frightened refugees, shipped off to work camps, or worse...
The Empire has a plan. And we should be honored to be part of it.
The Empire has led us to many victories. Today will be the same. 
The Empire has made you afraid of death: embrace it. Enjoy the fight.
The Empire has trained me well. The traitor will be eradicated.
The Empire is aware of the strength in its army. First, follow orders and succeed. 
The Empire is bleeding this planet.
The Empire is devouring Kashyyyk for its natural resources.
The Empire is never ending!
The Empire is picking up where it left off after rolling over Saw's forces.
The Empire knows about the holocron.
The Empire may not know about this place, but Bogano is still home to many dangerous creatures.
The Empire might have found a Zeffo tomb. We can't waste any time.
The Empire overran our position at the refinery.
The Empire shouldn't be digging here.
The Empire strengthens me. 
The Empire will always find you. 
The Empire will be after 'em.
The Empire will destroy you!
The Empire will find you.
The Empire will save all lives in the galaxy and protect them from murderous traitors. 
The Empire's a little safer now. 
The Empire's been busy.
The Empire's built on fear and indifference. By banding together we challenge its very existence.
The Empire's ruled by a Sith Lord. He wants all Jedi dead.
The Empire's smart. There's much here the Jedi believe to be sacred. Now it is under our control.
The Empire, they found Zeffo.
The Force can't save you!
The Force has provided a new path.
The Force is strong here.
The Force is there to shield us.
The Force is with me.
The Force is within you, around you, connecting you to your weapon.
The Force showed me something on Zeffo. Memories of someone named Ostar.
The Force won't save you.
The Haxion Brood is gunning for ya.
The Hutts or the Suns or somebody, I wasn't going to stick around and ask - I had to get us out of there!
The Inquisitor?
The Inquisitors have found us.
The Jedi Council?
The Jedi High Council member?
The Jedi are dead.
The Jedi are not yet lost.
The Jedi are scum. Worthless insects plaguing our galaxy. It is your responsibility to eradicate them. Understood?
The Jedi are smart and quick. I suggest you do the same, but better.
The Jedi are supposed to be symbols of hope, but... I led the Inquisition here.
The Jedi bleeds for us.
The Jedi do not seek aggression but we stand against it.
The Jedi escaped up there. 
The Jedi has fallen. 
The Jedi has fled. 
The Jedi has gone above.
The Jedi has stims.
The Jedi have worse things to fear than death.
The Jedi is a coward. 
The Jedi is above!
The Jedi is above. 
The Jedi is below us. 
The Jedi is below. 
The Jedi is beneath us.
The Jedi is doing something. 
The Jedi is down there. 
The Jedi is here!
The Jedi is here.
The Jedi is here. Above. 
The Jedi is in pain. 
The Jedi is just too quick. 
The Jedi is quick. 
The Jedi is right there!
The Jedi is running. Again. 
The Jedi is under us. 
The Jedi is weak!
The Jedi is weakened. 
The Jedi just healed. This'll be tough. 
The Jedi still fights!
The Jedi took out our heavy gunner!
The Jedi traitor is here. 
The Jedi used this place to study the sphere above. I can still feel the excitement.
The Jedi used to have some kind of temple here, but I can't find any data on it.
The Jedi was spotted on Zeffo.
The Jedi we train will help build a galaxy that respects and preserves special places like this one.
The Jedi were trained to disregard accolades...
The Jedi will be here any minute.
The Jedi will come. And the kill with be worth the wait.
The Jedi!
The Jedi! After him!
The Jedi! He's down there!
The Jedi! He's in the Interrogation Wing!
The Jedi! He's injured!
The Jedi! He's running again!
The Jedi's afraid!
The Jedi's beneath us!
The Jedi's come through! Attack!
The Jedi's gone again!
The Jedi's here!
The Jedi's here. 
The Jedi's injured!
The Jedi's running. Stay sharp. 
The Jedi's too quick!
The Jedi's up there!
The Jedi's up there.
The Jedi's using a stim!
The Jedi. Up there. 
The Jedi?
The Major wants all Auger files sent to Coruscant.
The Mantis works wonders, I mean it's a great ship, excellent pilot, but...
The Mantis? Why would I?
The Nightbrothers?
The Nightsister and her warrior kin...
The Nightsisters of Dathomir do not turn on their kind.
The Nightsisters of Dathomir granted me passage, but even they warned me against these ruins.
The Nightsisters used this in some type of ritual. Their magick gave them power.
The Nightsisters used to call their leader Mother. She used powerful Magick.
The Ninth Sister said something about becoming an Inquisitor, like...
The Ninth Sister's searching for us. I should call...
The Order is gone but the dream of what it represented still lives on in us, Cal. We can rebuild it - if we find Cordova's holocron.
The Partisans doubt the power of the Empire.
The Second Sister had little to say about the Jedi's strength, but remain vigilant.
The Second Sister has secured those sectors.
The Second Sister stationed us here due to our strength and ability. I devote my life to her. 
The Second Sister...
The Separatist Dreadnought has jumped to lightspeed, General.
The Vault itself is built like a giant holocron.
The Vault was built by an ancient civilization called the Zeffo.
The Vault? Yeah, that's where I was headed too.
The Wookiees are free! Get to the roof!
The Wookiees have suffered enough.
The Zeffo Astrium.
The Zeffo crafted this artifact as an offering to the wind. It was destroyed intentionally for some reason.
The Zeffo went to Kashyyyk. Cordova mentioned someone named Tarfful.
The beast is mine.
The beasts are not easy to kill.
The beasts got into the larder!
The best is yet to come...
The best trooper is a smart trooper.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall!
The bounty hunters are persistent.
The bounty's down there. 
The bounty. Above. 
The call is getting stronger. Let's hurry.
The captain won't be pleased. You better let me report this one.
The chase is on. 
The children on that list.
The climb has given me time to reflect.
The clones have betrayed us.
The closer we get to the Vault, the stronger it feels.
The commander was killed by a lightsaber.
The crawlers are swarming in greater numbers.
The crawlers never crossed the witches.
The creature must be appeased.
The crystal shattered.
The damage done to Outpost Grek 55 was most certainly carried out by insurgents.
The damage incurred was minimal.
The dark side clouded every attempt at finding one on Dathomir, but the Force provided a new path!
The dark side?
The darkness always has an effect, one way or another.
The darkness clouded every attempt at finding the Astrium inside Kujet's Tomb but the Force...
The darkness here...
The day we destroy the Jedi grows ever closer. As we speak, our drills get closer to the heart of this planet.
The distance to the target is too far.
The distinctive striations.
The door controls!
The door's jammed!
The droids are down.
The enemy approaches. 
The enemy has evaded again. 
The enemy has fled!
The enemy has gone below.
The enemy has stims.
The enemy is above us!
The enemy is above!
The enemy is beneath us. 
The enemy is severely hurt. 
The enemy is severely injured!
The enemy is up there.
The enemy is up there. 
The enemy! He's above!
The enemy's down there. 
The energy is different here.
The energy swirling in those clouds has been building for countless years. Imagine: a storm that never ends.
The entire mission is now at risk.
The entrance is here. Malicos was interested in this tomb as well.
The era of the Jedi is over.
The exact opposite of what you should do.
The excavation has yielded minimal information on the original inhabitants.
The excavation has yielded tremendous results.
The explosion will mask our escape.
The faster they move, the stronger the challenge. I accept.
The fate of the Jedi Order lies in your hands.
The fewer distractions, the better.
The fight is over here.
The fire support is out.
The fire's spreading!
The flames! They're everywhere!
The fugitive is here! I've sealed him in.
The galaxy will bow before me!
The galaxy would be a better place if they did.
The gift? Yeah. A datapad to put all her recipes on. Made her day.
The greater control we sought, the further we fell into ruin.
The guild keeps cutting into my wages!
The guild will double your pay for this shift.
The holocron is being kept in the interrogation chamber.
The homeworld of the Zeffo. Cordova must have spent a lot of time here.
The humidity is affecting my scanners.
The intel was right. This weapon is real.
The interloper is more powerful than us.
The interloper seeks to divide us!
The intruder escaped up there. 
The intruder is attempting escape. 
The intruder is below. 
The intruder is here!
The intruder is now above. 
The intruder is weak!
The kid's not too bad with that light sword.
The last flametrooper is down. 
The last thing I spent so much time searching for was the right gift to give my great-grandma,
The lift isn't here.
The lift!
The lives of every child on that list are at stake.
The lives of every child on that list will be forever changed.
The lock's fried, we're in!
The log left for Cal... Nothing else?
The look on her face when she saw what they had done to me. As I am now.
The loss has become a part of me.
The machines are destroyed.
The mighty winged Gorgara flies with fury.
The monsters outside, the Empire that's probably still after us, and yes, the witch who raised the dead to kill us...
The more I clean, cook, whatever little thing I can find, it's a victory to get it done, ya know? 
The more information we gather on Cordova and the Zeffo, the closer we'll get to stopping the Empire. 
The most beautiful holographic image of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
The mountain beasts are foul and forceful.
The name's redacted, but this must be it!
The next generation of Jedi. I knew it!
The next generation of Jedi. The Empire will kill them if they find them.
The next generation of Jedi...
The nydaks fear me.
The obstacles in your path define the path.
The offer stands.
The ones who built this tomb, the Zeffo, they created an object called the Astrium. 
The only Jedi in here are dead ones.
The only dead things I want to see on the Mantis should be on my plate.
The only thing left was a lightsaber.
The only thing we can. Keep fighting.
The operation is expanding into Sector 7. They call it the Shadowlands. It's crawling with hostiles.
The outsider can't pass us. 
The outsider flees from us. 
The outsider is below us!
The outsider is dead. 
The outsider is weak. 
The outsider may not be alone.
The outsider runs from us!
The outsider wants to take Dathomir from us. 
The outsider will be stopped. Our brothers' might is strong. 
The outsider!
The outsider! And he's weak!
The pain! More!
The planet looks like it goes on forever.
The poor crazy old guy was left alone.
The real action is on Zeffo...
The refinery is destroyed. The Wookiees were freed. Saw knew there was no way he could liberate an entire planet.
The ritual is complicated. It was difficult enough to teach myself the first part.
The safest route to the Shadowlands is below us.
The safest route to the Shadowlands is nearby.
The scale of this operation is massive. If the Empire plans to bleed Ilum like Kashyyyk, who knows what they could do.
The scazz. Whatever they are. Bit through my boot. 
The scomp link is busted, but...
The side of the Force that feeds on pain, hatred and fear. Tap into it and you risk of losing yourself.
The situation is being handled.
The snake is here. 
The sphere in the lantern... I wonder if there's a way to get it down?
The storm, the temple. It all feels connected somehow.
The strong survive. 
The strongest Nightbrothers faced a rite of passage by venturing into the lair of this creature.
The surface is that way, through the Nightmare Ruins. 
The target caused quite a ruckus on Zeffo.
The target destroyed a key facility on Kashyyyk.
The target did some damage to a base on Zeffo.
The target has vanished.
The target is quick.
The target is too far.
The time has come.
The train stopped?
The traitor is below us. 
The traitor is down there!
The traitor wants to sow chaos.
The tram is your fastest way back to the cargo pad.
The trespasser is weak!
The trick is to cover your tracks so they don't know you're listening.
The turbolift - let's go!
The villager was wounded. But he took out a Trooper.
The villagers built this memorial to the clones on the Venator. If only they knew the truth.
The wall's in bad shape. Might be fragile.
The war never ended here. Everything we did...
The war took a lot of people from us. But we're still here. Don't forget that, Greez.
The warmth is nice.
The water can be, uh, distracting. Sir.
The way is above us.
The way is here.
The weak deserve to perish. 
The weapon you wield is still mine, apprentice.
The whole squad is down...
The wind through the trench always sounded like blaster fire to me.
The wind's picked up from the north.
The witches would collect it.
The workers - 
Their beliefs lead to chaos and suffering. It is an honor to protect the galaxy from such dangerous insurgents.
Their deaths mean nothing!
Their destiny should be trusted to the Force.
Their frenzy is a good omen.
Their graves are all around you.
Their numbers grow each season.
Their packs are most dangerous.
Their powers focused on deception, illusion, manipulation.
Their skin is too thick to chew.
Them Clone Wars were fierce!
Them crazy Riggers can't seem to understand that.
Then Dathomir will be your grave.
Then I guess the crystal's gotta be in place first.
Then Malicos came.
Then came the Empire.
Then don't touch it.
Then find a closer vantage point next time.
Then focus on the job and let the officers worry about artifacts.
Then he must die!
Then hurry up, soldier! We don't have time for rookie mistakes.
Then it will come for Dathomir before long, as the war did.
Then it will come for Dathomir before long.
Then it'll be an adventure for all of us.
Then just stay out of my way.
Then let us see what manner of death your courage brings.
Then let's find shelter.
Then let's show this traitor the power of the Empire!
Then stop complaining!
Then the Republic became the Empire. The poor became indentured servants. 
Then there can only be one culprit: the stowaway!
Then there's still hope.
Then we better get ready for a fight.
Then we better get this holo-thing fast.
Then we better start killing some Partisans.
Then we fight to win. 
Then we have something in common. Safe journey, Cal.
Then we have the advantage... for now. 
Then we have to get there.
Then we'll convince them.
Then we've still got a chance.
Then what does?
Then you'll be left behind. Troops, move out!
Then you're on the right ship.
There are Imperial forces nearby. We should be careful.
There are holes in this rock, like something's been climbing it.
There are many different perceptions of the Force, Cal.
There are many such places here on Dathomir.
There are many who depend on you whether they know it or not. Don't doubt yourself, Cal.
There are no answers to your questions, not yet.
There are still Imperial troops here, Cal. Be careful.
There are traitors hiding throughout the galaxy. Trust our orders and you will be rewarded. 
There could be useful intel inside.
There goes a hauler.
There goes my promotion.
There goes my score!
There goes our bounty. 
There goes our safety record.
There goes our score!
There goes their air support. 
There he goes again. 
There he goes. 
There he goes. Scared him. 
There he is!
There he is! Shoot to kill.
There is a good chance Chieftain Tarfful will know about it.
There is a greater journey ahead.
There is an override just ahead.
There is another entrance to this tomb.
There is more: what appears to be coordinates to the Zeffo system!
There is no escape from us!
There is no escape!
There is no hope for you.
There is no place for you here. The Brothers will kill you if you stay.
There is no way we're leaving them here, we have to get them out.
There is nothing to do... on this rock! Nothing to challenge us!
There is now.
There is nowhere I can go without feeling their absence. Yet their memory gives me strength.
There is power there.
There is something down there, though.
There is the Empire!
There it goes!
There she goes again.
There was a battle, the ship went down. But there were survivors.
There was a problem with the refresher. Now I'm not saying I know who it is...
There was nothing here last time I looked.
There was something about it that just felt... free. That's gone now.
There we go. Thanks.
There were more survivors.
There were so many I... thought I'd flank them.
There were some close calls out there.
There will be times when emotion...
There you are!
There you are.
There you are. Listen, kid, I'm not here to tell you what to do or how to do it,
There!
There! Above us!
There! Down there!
There! Up there!
There's a Jedi out there, on the loose.
There's a fortress.
There's a long journey ahead of us.
There's a lot more information to gather.
There's a lot more to see throughout the galaxy.
There's a lot to learn here. Good luck.
There's a noise back there. 
There's a noise there. 
There's a person there. 
There's a reason he's evaded the Empire this long.
There's a reason why no one wants to visit this desolate planet.
There's a report of a situation on Ordo Eris.
There's a storm up ahead. Something about it crippled the Empire's equipment.
There's a strange energy here. I vaguely remember Cordova talking about something called magickal ichors.
There's always a chance.
There's an enemy.
There's an intruder above!
There's an intruder. 
There's bounties out on people like you...
There's gotta be a way around.
There's gotta be a way to the tomb now.
There's gotta be another sphere somewhere.
There's gotta be some information on their excavation inside, right?
There's heat coming from those cracks underwater, but it's freezing up here.
There's more to be discovered on Dathomir.
There's more to come and I'm not sure either of our imaginations could conjure up what we might face.
There's never been a breach of this sector.
There's no future for them.
There's no more guys between us and the enemy - it's the end!
There's no pulse.
There's no technique Cere has that I haven't perfected.
There's no way forward.
There's no way they could've put a tracker on us.
There's no winning this!
There's not just wind rippling through these chimes. Voices...from the past?
There's nothing for you here.
There's nothing stopping us now.
There's only one way to find out. We have to go to Kashyyyk.
There's our bounty. 
There's so much wind blowing in here. 
There's someone here I think you should meet.
There's something about this place.
There's something on that rock, BD.
There's something really peaceful about watching a plant grow.
There's something there the Emperor wants.
There's something weird about this place.
There's still a chance.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There's still much to do. 
There's still no results. I wonder what's gonna happen to us.
There's still so much the Empire hasn't touched.
There's the Jedi!
There's the landing pad. 
There's too many!
There. Above us. 
There. Below. 
These Partisans are nothing compared to the strength of a Jedi.
These Wookiees are useless.
These Zeffo were once Kujet's enemies, brave rebels who stood against tyranny.
These ancient tombs didn't survive all this time because they were easy to find. 
These are dark times.
These are the remains of a Zeffonian. A laborer, worked to death.
These children you seek to protect... Who are they to you?
These games are pointless!
These have been hard years.
These insurgents - their only purpose is to die. 
These insurgents are nothing. 
These jawtraps fake the scent of food to catch prey?
These jerks.
These look pretty sharp, huh BD?
These machines are pointless.
These people are willing to put their lives on the line and do whatever it takes to finish the Empire for good.
These people, they owe a lot to you.
These plants kinda remind me of Greez's fur.
These refineries double as brutal prison camps. We'll use those cutters to create a distraction while you...
These savages only respect strength.
These skills mean nothing. 
These species are all from different planets. This is weird.
These stims won't save you!
These stories are playing out all over the galaxy.
These supplies are new. Why were they left behind?
These things are getting big.
These things are pretty cute.
These things don't even live long enough to count. 
These trees...
These tricks won't save you.
These were made by a lightsaber.
These were used in Zeffo meditation rituals. I believe they were training Force users.
These workers lack proper leadership and motivation, which you cannot provide. You're relieved.
These... Exploration droids are good tools for that sort of thing.
They  just keep coming...
They are all the same. They're traitors in the eyes of the Empire. 
They are coming.
They are everywhere!
They are too many of them!
They aren't getting up after that. 
They breached the Shadowlands.
They broke them, beat them down, and turned them to the dark side.
They brought Trilla in the room.
They brought more firepower than we thought.
They call 'em radicals. I heard the Empire's got bounties on their heads.
They called it the Life Wind, and those who wielded it, sages.
They can't all be dead... can they?
They can't breach our choke point!
They can? Good. Understood. I'll keep my guard up.
They change them regularly, but with a little skill and luck, I figure out what's coming and where to patch in.
They couldn't beat you. I can.
They deactivate droids just because they can. That makes him one of us.
They definitely used the Force.
They destroyed countless lives grasping for power. I wouldn't be surprised or...
They didn't make it... that ain't the point, though.
They don't give transfers. You know that.
They don't just want to take Kashyyyk's resources, they want to make sure there's nothing left.
They don't look friendly.
They don't run from our hunting parties. A few have started travelling together.
They don't, but that's no reason to let down our guard. We can't afford any mistakes.
They even named a drink after me!
They find a Jedi there to kill?
They got a couple hits in.
They got me!
They have become too focused on Jedi history, but the history of the Force belongs to us all.
They have horns, you have a blaster. You can shoot them.
They haven't seen us. Keep your guard up.
They heeded Nightsister magicks.
They hurt someone close to me. A lot of people. But now that's going to change.
They know they're tactically overwhelmed.
They like you.
They made their choice. We have a larger battle to fight.
They never do, kid. They never do.
They refine the sap into a powerful compound and they're rushing to expand production.
They said it was safe up here.
They shot the coupling out.
They should have never believed in you.
They should have trained harder.
They showed me what I had caused.
They smell like used droid oil, heh heh. At least you're okay.
They stand no chance to me alone. 
They towered over you but there wasn't a part of me that was afraid. 
They used the Force? What, like Jedi?
They wanted to know about the others and...
They were always off doing their thing and we Lateros took care of our own. We never got help from Jedi.
They were frustrated with the Jedi Council!
They were holding me back. 
They were in my way. 
They were just in my way.
They were never even buried. So many Nightsisters died here. They didn't even stand a chance.
They were never tracking us.
They were too weak to kill you.
They were unskilled and useless!
They will be the ones who made a mistake. 
They will bow as well as their Wookiee friends.
They will consume us if we do not stand...
They will have their revenge.
They will. I am certain of it.
They won't be using that anytime soon. 
They won't get past us.
They won't stop until everyone's wiped out.
They would never have found me...
They'll be okay.
They're a nice reminder of where we've been.
They're all down. Let's move. 
They're an outsider. And we don't trust them. That's enough. 
They're approaching!
They're coming!
They're fast, keep firing!
They're gone.
They're growing fast.
They're just insurgents - nothing else. 
They're keeping wildlife in these cells?
They're linked.
They're lucky to have us. We're in this together, Greez.
They're mining kyber crystals.
They're not getting past me.
They're not going to stop us. 
They're not responding!
They're out there. Whoa, hold on! Wait a minute!
They're preoccupied with something on the ground...
They're pretty.
They're really growing in there.
They're ripping the planet apart.
They're searching for the Mantis as we speak.
They're still assessing the damage  to Refinery Aurek-50.
They're up there.
They've anticipated our route and sealed the airlock.
They've been used by the Jedi to store information for a long time.
They've broken through and called reinforcements! Every star destroyer in the sector is on their way here.
They've got heavies!
They've got reinforcements!
They've really stepped it up.
They've ruined this planet and they'll destroy more.
They've taken cover in isolated pockets.
Things are even worse here than on Zeffo.
Things are going well, aren't they?
Things have certainly gotten better.
Things have gotten tough, huh?
Think I found what you wanted me to see.
Think I got a wyyyschokk.
Think I need help here. 
Think I need help with this.
Think I saw someone.
Think I saw something.
Think he's still around?
Think there's more spheres around here?
Think this stops me?
Think we can burn the vines?
Think we can slice this thing?
Think we could plug something in here?
Think we should check that out?
Think we should keep moving?
Think we'll get overtime this week?
Think we're doing okay, BD?
Think you can break in?
Think you can handle this, BD?
Think you can help me, BD?
Think you can help with this?
Think you can match me?
Think you can run?
Think you can show me that shortcut again?
Think you can slice it?
Think you stand a chance?
Think your tough stuff?
Think, think.
Thinking about something good I hope.
This 'terrarium' would look better with some plants.
This Cordova guy is really putting some wear and tear on my ship.
This Empire. How far does it stretch?
This Guardian was destroyed long ago.
This Imperial contract is Bantha poodoo!
This Jedi better be well trained. I have expectations.
This Jedi fears us greatly. 
This Jedi has yet to disappoint!
This Jedi is all tricks and games.
This Jedi is clever.
This Jedi is dangerous. 
This Jedi is just a loose end from the Clone Wars. He'll be dealt with. 
This Jedi must be a fool.
This Jedi...
This area is secure.
This area was used for meditation... by someone familiar with the Jedi Order.
This baby was a steal. Well, I didn't steal it... I bought it. Well, sort of... almost. Took out a small loan...
This beast is nothing.
This bird might be the last of its kind.
This bounty is mine. 
This can't hold me!
This cannot hold me!
This child fears us. 
This could be just the start.
This crate was moved here by Stormtroopers. They seemed anxious for some reason, pressured to find relics.
This creature is mine.
This creature must be eliminated.
This does not deter me. 
This does nothing. 
This doesn't hurt. 
This doesn't look good.
This doesn't make any sense, what is going on?
This door needs to open. 
This door's not budging. 
This droid, he serves you?
This ends soon. 
This ends, now.
This fell from a Wookiee as they climbed the tree. Some type of test.
This fight is mine. 
This fight is over.
This fight was a mistake. 
This fight's your last.
This guy just won't give up.
This guy was in deep! Last I heard, he was thinking about fighting in the arena to pay off his debt. 
This has escalated.
This hilt belonged to Cordova.
This is BD-1. He only speaks binary.
This is Bogano.
This is Greezy Time, kid. Go someplace else for a while.
This is L9-7240 reporting in. We've got confirmed casualties.
This is Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.
This is Miktrull at the Vault on Bogano.
This is Saw.
This is TK-8190.
This is a Jedi?
This is a crutch!
This is a deadly, dangerous place.
This is a mistake. 
This is a waste of time, what is Krane playing at? Impossible that anything useful is in here.
This is above my paygrade.
This is an illusion.
This is an important place for Jedi.
This is bad.
This is boring. 
This is foolishness. 
This is futile!
This is gonna end one way or another.
This is gonna hurt, okay?
This is gonna look great on my record.
This is gonna sound strange, but I think it's the Astrium.
This is incredible!
This is it for us!
This is it!
This is it! Hurry and get him!
This is it! We can't afford to lose!
This is it.
This is it. 
This is meaningless resistance. 
This is never going to end.
This is never going to end...
This is new.
This is no challenge.
This is no common anarchist but a devotee of the treasonous Jedi Order.
This is not a place to relax and eat. Let's get going, I'm starving.
This is not how gravity works!
This is not what I signed up for.
This is not your day.
This is nothing.
This is only the beginning.
This is our planet.
This is pathetic.
This is pointless!
This is pointless, padawan!
This is really gonna help us!
This is the end of my charter.
This is the end!
This is the end, Padawan.
This is the greatest machine ever built.
This is the key and the guide.
This is the price of your arrogance!
This is the same kind of sphere and socket from Zeffo!
This is the worst blizzard I've ever seen.
This is too easy.
This is unexpected. Curious to see how it works out.
This is what we expected.
This is what we want! This is what we LOVE!
This is why you are weak!
This is your end. 
This isn't a discussion! Leaving Kashyyyk is our only chance for survival.
This isn't fair. 
This isn't good.
This kid is something else, isn't he?!
This kid is the real deal!
This kill is mine. 
This looks interesting.
This looks like a safe place to meditate.
This man has promised to grant us our vengeance, but only if I teach him our magick...
This may be the last you see of me.
This might be a peaceful place, but it doesn't mean it can't be dangerous. 
This might be trouble.
This mission comes with a lot of risks, new ones everyday. I hope you're not having second thoughts.
This motor should do the trick. How does it feel?
This must be the Zeffo ruler. Surrounded by their victims for eternity.
This must be the tomb.
This must be where the Nightbrothers live.
This needs power. 
This one has fight in him. 
This one has some skill. 
This one is a coward!
This one is dead.
This one is mine.
This one is mine. 
This one is quick. 
This one lacks skill!
This one looks hurt.
This one wouldn't leave your side.
This one's fast!
This one's good!
This one's got some moves. 
This one's green. 
This one's had some training.  
This one's mine!
This one's mine.
This one's mine. 
This one's quick.
This one's quick. 
This opens from the other side.
This outsider fears out strength. 
This outsider is dangerous.
This outsider must be punished. 
This outsider stands no chance to our brothers. 
This outsider will pay. 
This pad supports an Imperial Refinery that runs on Wookiee slave labor.
This pain means nothing!
This pain....it's what I felt.
This place feels like a battlefield.
This place is a nightmare.
This place is evil.
This place is where the Empire created the Inquisitors.
This place reminds me of Dathomir. Once sacred - now broken. 
This place seems abandoned but...
This place used to be home to a powerful cabal of Force wielders known as the Nightsisters.
This place was designed to keep others out. A place of secrets.
This place, it's...
This place, less a tomb and more a temple to one ruler's pride.
This planet has failed to yield significant data or relics for Project Auger.
This planet has remained nearly untouched for centuries.
This planet is something else...
This planet is under the full control of the Empire.
This planet's not ready to give up its secrets.
This planet, their homeworld, has been a revelation!
This power is beyond your control!
This prison is where they kept us. I only wish there was someone left to save.
This relic is extremely old but I get the sense it was part of some type of training ritual for Zeffo Force-users.
This running does nothing. 
This running is futile.
This ship has almost been through as much as we have. Incredible.
This ship has seen a lot of action.
This should be quick. 
This should help you get moving for now.
This so-called Jedi killed my old commander on Zeffo.
This socket is the same one we saw in the other tomb.
This terminal will have to wait.
This thing grows fast.
This thing is barely flying!
This thing is mine.
This thing needs your overcharge. 
This thing's not so scary. 
This things got your name all over it.
This tool was used by someone eager to reach the Vault.
This training session will last as long as it needs. You will comprehend the lesson of the day. One way or another.
This tree. It provides a safe pilgrimage for those who listen.
This trooper was dragged here by some type of creature.
This tunnel flooded suddenly. What could have caused such a thing?
This used to be a Jedi temple or something...
This victory is mine alone.
This war is far from over, but it's worth everything to fight it. Even if we don't know the outcome.
This was an arena once. The Nightbrothers only respect those with power.
This was an offering to the Sage buried here. At the time it was considered precious.
This was deliberately destroyed. I can still feel the hate of the act.
This was lit as a sign of respect and reverence for the Sage buried here.
This wasn't in the briefing.
This way!
This way.
This way. 
This whole journey has put a lot of wear and tear on the Mantis.
This will be an easy win.
This will be easy.
This will be fun. 
This will be hard without melee support.
This will be hard without rocket troopers. 
This will be simple.
This will be too easy. 
This will be tough without a flametrooper. 
This will just take a minute. Or two. 
This will not save you. 
This will not stop me. 
This woman you travel with, who is she?
This won't be our last victory.
This won't be worth my time.
This won't end well.
This won't end well...
This won't hold me.
This won't save you. 
This won't stop me!
This won't stop me.
This won't stop me. 
This wookiee died from toxic fumes... The Empire is poisoning the planet.
This wroshyr looks great, Greez.
This! Is a Jedi?
This'll be a nice addition to the terrarium.
This'll be easy. 
This'll be fast.
This... (chuckle)
This... can't happen!
This... hasn't happened before!
This... is what I've wanted!
This... place. This... Vault is a sacred temple.
This... war is not over, my Padawan.
Those Jedi... a real tragedy.
Those cutters won't wait, Cal.
Those don't look safe.
Those names on the list...they're a test. And I believe I will succeed.
Those roots are gonna be a problem.
Those slubs? I'll hear 'em coming from a parsec away.
Those stims really helped.
Those things give me the creeps.
Those vines look like they lead somewhere.
Those walkers double as troop transports so once you get inside... be careful.
Those walls won't help you. 
Those were animal corpses.
Those windmills on the mountain sure are something, aren't they?
Those winds are interfering with our comms.
Though much of this tomb is well preserved, these are uniformly destroyed. An interesting puzzle.
Thought this job would be harder. 
Thought you could run?
Thought you were a Jedi?
Threat has gone astray.
Threat neutralized.
Threat present.
Three names appear with frequency: Eilram, Miktrull, Kujet.
Three... six... eight... Wait, um...
Through there? Not unless we have no other choice.
Throw a stim!
Throw it!
Throw me a stim, BD.
Throw me a stim, bud.
Thwarted.
Tight fit, but that should work.
Tight fit, huh BD?
Time for No Freeze Greez to work his magic.
Time for a stim!
Time for an easy kill. 
Time for some action!
Time for some fun.
Time to collect those credits!
Time to collect!
Time to collect.
Time to contemplate my next attack.
Time to die!
Time to drop 'em!
Time to end it!
Time to end it. 
Time to end this.
Time to end this. 
Time to end this...
Time to fight!
Time to fight. 
Time to find the others.
Time to get paid!
Time to get paid, huh?
Time to get paid. 
Time to go!
Time to go.
Time to go? Great. Hate sittin' around like this.
Time to just wait...
Time to kill!
Time to land. Get up here. 
Time to move in on him.
Time to report our success. 
Time to slice!
Time to stop you for good.
Time to thin the herd.
Time to work.
Time to work. 
Tired already?
Tiresome.
Tisk Tisk, Jedi.
To access the holocron you must seek out the tombs of three great Zeffo Sages.
To be fair we didn't train shooting charging, horned creatures.
To honor Steela's sacrifice. She died for our freedom. I'll never stop fighting for that.
To make us all...
To preserve the Order,
To rebuild from our mistakes.
To rebuild the Jedi Order.
To rid Dathomir of that parasite.
To risk death?
To the Empire... we're all just expendable.
To the prisons! We need the Wookiees to finish this!
To the trenches!
Today, our great military is dedicated to enforcing the laws of the Empire,
Together! Pursue the intruder!
Together, we will rule Dathomir. 
Together.
Tomb or no tomb, they should drill the whole thing into dust.
Tombs freak me out. Let's do what we gotta do and then leave.
Tonight we celebrate those fallen challengers of the past.
Too afraid to fight me?
Too afraid to say it.
Too afraid? 
Too bold!
Too close!
Too close, Jedi. 
Too close.
Too close...
Too close... way too close. 
Too dwoo!
Too dwoo?
Too easy!
Too easy.
Too easy. 
Too fast for you?
Too fast?
Too many nydaks on the trail.
Too many on the Core Worlds. Their daily lives haven't changed much since the Empire took over. 
Too much for ya, huh?
Too much for you!
Too much for you. 
Too much for you?
Too much, huh? I'll take it. 
Too quick for you!
Too quick for you. 
Too quick.
Too quick. 
Too quick...
Too scared to fight?
Too scared, Jedi?
Too scared?
Too slow!
Too slow, Jedi!
Too slow, Jedi. 
Too slow.
Too slow. 
Too soon.
Took a hit.
Took a hit. 
Took it down!
Took out at least one AT-ST as well.
Took out one of our scout walkers.
Took out the bridge. 
Top notch combat skills and an unstoppable devotion to destroying anyone who threatens the Empire.
Torture.
Toss it here.
Toss it!
Toss me a stim, BD-1.
Toss me a stim, bud!
Toss me a stim, buddy?
Toss me one, BD!
Totally Useless.
Tough guy, huh?
Tougher than expected.
Track him. 
Tracking target. 
Tracking the enemy!
Tracking the target.
Tracking the target. 
Train is stopped.
Training pays off. 
Traitor!
Traitorous killer!
Trajectory modified.
Trauma inflicted.
Treacherous Jedi!
Treasonous Jedi factions will only increase the insurgency there.
Treating your wounds?
Trespasser!
Trespasser! Down there!
Trickery will not help.
Tricks won't trip me.
Tricky. 
Trifling maneuver.
Trill be-beep!
Trill beeeep!
Trill boo boop!
Trill woo!
Trill!
Trill! Be-beep?
Trill! Beep boop beep?
Trill!!
Trill.
Trilla will be watching. 
Trilla, what's going to happen?
Trilla.
Trivial opposition.
Trouble headed our way.
True, but it still leaves a mark. Your friend Cere - it is clear she carries great pain.
True, sir. But I wonder what brought him here?
Trust me!
Trust me.
Trust only in the Force.
Trust only...
Trust or blind faith. As time went on, I found myself more interested in experiences, friendship,
Try again!
Try again.
Try again. Trust yourself.
Try and catch me now. 
Try and catch me!
Try and keep up!
Try and relax.
Try and run.
Try and stop me.
Try and stop this!
Try blocking now!
Try dodging that. 
Try fighting instead.
Try harder!
Try harder, weakling. 
Try harder. 
Try me, Jedi!
Try not to hurt yourself. 
Try not to wiggle so much this time.
Try stopping these. 
Try switching to short-range thermal detection.
Try that again!
Try that again.
Try that on me.
Try that with me. I'll break you.
Try that.
Try to endure this!
Try to slice into this one. 
Try to stop him. 
Trying to hide down there?
Trying to remember our patrol protocol. 
Trying to run, Jedi?
Trying to slow me?
Trying to sneak down there?
Turn back, Jedi.
Turn it off, Greez.
Turn that droid!
Turn the cutter on!
Turn yourself in or everyone present shall face summary execution. 
Twee dee doo!
Twee dee doo?
Twee dee!
Twee doo boo!
Twee doo!
Twee oo doo!
Twee!
Tweep!
Two!? We're doomed.
Twoo boo doo!
Twoo!
U-u-up there! There!
U-understood.
U-up there!
Ugh - too fast. 
Ugh!
Ugh! Agh! No!
Ugh! Flame beetle.
Ugh! I... I'm trapped!
Ugh! No more close quarters support!
Ugh! This beautiful ship, it just keeps giving me a hard time.
Ugh! What was that?
Ugh! You scum!
Ugh, another easy kill.
Ugh, finally he arrives.
Ugh, it burns! 
Ugh.
Ugh. Back on patrol duty.
Ugh. I hate those things with the big teeth.
Ugh. I see you down there.
Ugh. My boots are always a little loose. 
Ugh. This is not my day.
Ugh. What a terrible way to go. 
Ugh...
Ugh... I lost count. 
Uh huh. 
Uh oh.
Uh oh. 
Uh oh. I'm gonna need cover. 
Uh oh. Just me now. 
Uh oh. Watch out!
Uh then just... shoot at your feet. Problem solved.
Uh, BD, that's a little small for me.
Uh, I think he just took out our last rocket trooper. Not really sure. 
Uh, fine...
Uh, glory's okay, I guess...
Uh, okay.
Uh, that was our last droid. Guess it's my turn. 
Uh, yeah I'm okay. I'm just...
Uh, yes! Yes, sir!
Uh. Yeah. She still freaks me out, you know the whole raising the dead thing, but as long as she doesn't kill me...
Uh... been a lot of process changes recently, sir. Twelve rotations, max. 
Uh... hey there, little guy.
Uh... okay. I guess you're good.
Uh... right. Got it. Point and shoot.
Uh... sir? Are you okay?
Uh... yes, sir. We removed all of the natives. And there haven't been any surprises. Isn't that good?
Uhh!
Uhh...
Uhh... Hmm... Mmhmm? Hmm.
Uhh... sorry, I'm not quite fluent.
Uhhh. I think we have a jotaz.
Um, alright.
Um. So, I got to ask...
Unauthorized entity detected, investigating.
Unauthorized exit.
Unbind me, Jedi.
Uncivilized.
Understandable
Understood.
Understood. 
Understood. For the cause.
Understood. I am prepared to eliminate any traitor who attempts to cross our path.
Understood. I'll take him out.
Understood. I'm ready. 
Understood. Still though. I'd love to see that beast hit the ground. 
Unessential.
Unexpected.
Unfortunately not.
Unfortunately not. He took extreme measures to protect the holocron. 
Unfortunately, the same is true for our vessel. 
Unfortunately, things changed when we got older. Funny shaped rocks didn't go so far anymore.
Unfortunately, yes. The Emperor gave her this mission for a reason... 
Unknown malfunction.
Unless the wind picks up.
Unless we stop the Empire, we'll all be gone - hidden or not.
Unless you want to go, kid. Leave me be.
Unless you're an Inquisitor. Our orders are to get the job done fast.
Unlike most, you're alive.
Unlike the Jedi - 
Unload on him!
Unnecessary force.
Unprecedented. 
Unproductive human.
Unprofessional.
Unsteady?
Unsuccessful.
Until I was left alone.
Until death takes him.
Until now. 
Until then...
Up here!
Up here.
Up there maybe?
Up there!
Up there!!
Up there, yes...
Up there. 
Up there. The enemy.
Up there. The outsider! 
Use caution when encountering a wyyyschokk, they will cover the ground with a sticky web to restrict enemy movement.
Use that power on me. 
Use the Force to push the ball at the target.
Use the Force.
Used by the Zeffo Sages millennia ago.
Used to?
Useless droids!
Useless droids.
Useless pest!
Useless power.
Useless.
Useless. 
Using stims wont help you.
Using tricks, Jedi?
Validated.
Valueless.
Vashe.
Vengeance for my sisters.
Vent's open. Go!
Verified.
Very basic.
Very dangerous situation on Bracca.
Very few have stepped foot on this planet.
Very good, Jedi.
Very good, Padawan. You've cleared the way.
Very good, buddy. 
Very good.
Very good. Yeah, the Second Sister tried to compliment me but I was too busy fighting.
Very helpful. 
Very nice. 
Very simple.
Very well, leave him to me.
Very well.
Very well. 
Very well. You won't dodge the next.
Vicious snake!
Victory is assured. 
Victory is focus. 
Victory will be mine. 
Vines? They're the only thing holding that chain together.
Visitation is not permitted.
Visual anomaly detected. 
Visual contact. 
W-watch the ground! We got scazz!
W-we got a flame beetle!
W-what about you?
W-what if it doesn't stop?
W-what?
W-what?!
W-where?
W-why'd you choose to stop using the Force?
W-won't happen again!
W... what?
WHAT? With the Empire on your tail?! Are you crazy, kid?
WOOOO-HOO!
Waarrr.
Wai- Huh? No, no I was just gonna...
Wait for him to fall. 
Wait for the Jedi Council's signal.
Wait up! It might be dangerous!
Wait!
Wait, can you carry more?
Wait, do you hear that?
Wait, hold on. I'm not here to...
Wait, what do you mean, maybe?
Wait, what?
Wait, what? Explain that.
Wait, what? Me? Don't spread rumors, it ain't nice. He's just probably happy to... See someone other than a Bogling.
Wait, what?!? I fly my ship into the middle of a battlefield and now we're talking about risks!?
Wait, you didn't?
Wait? What? Who? No, no, I'm talking about Master Yaddle.
Waiting.
Walkers approaching their position.
Walls won't help you.
Wanna check it out?
Wanna fight, Jedi?
Wanna see inside?
Want to look inside?
Want to take a look?
Want to try it out?
War changes all the time. I'm sure you remember that from your time in the Clone Wars.
Warning, flame beetles spontaneously explode when predators approach.
Was that a person?
Was that our last flametrooper?
Was that our last ranged trooper?
Was that our last rocket trooper?
Was that the last Jedi?
Was that...
Wasn't expecting this.
Wasn't expecting this. 
Wasn't much to do growing up on Utapau besides shoot rock-vultures.
Waste of a stim.
Waste of our time.
Waste of power!
Wasteful tactic.
Watch above. 
Watch all around. The outsider could be anywhere. 
Watch below. 
Watch for crawlers!
Watch him drop. 
Watch him move!
Watch him repair himself!
Watch him run. 
Watch him!
Watch him! 
Watch him! Could be a trap.
Watch him! He repairs himself!
Watch him, Brothers!
Watch him. 
Watch him. I need a minute.
Watch him. Watch him.
Watch him. We're out of backup. 
Watch his blade.
Watch his hands. 
Watch his lightsaber!
Watch his parry.
Watch his saber!
Watch his speed.
Watch his weapon!
Watch it!
Watch it! 
Watch it! He's recovering.

Watch it! Wyyyschokk!
Watch it, Jedi!
Watch it.

Watch it. Phillak here.
Watch it. Slyyyg.
Watch it. We don't have ranged support. 
Watch its missiles!
Watch my back!
Watch my back! 
Watch my back.
Watch my back. 
Watch my back. She could still be around.
Watch out below. 
Watch out for him. 
Watch out for his magic.
Watch out for the phillak. They're dangerous and territorial.
Watch out or you'll be next. 
Watch out we got a flyer.
Watch out!
Watch out! Get to cover. 
Watch out! He's deadly.
Watch out! He's moving!
Watch out! He's quick! 
Watch out! Mykal!
Watch out! We've got mykal.
Watch out, BD!
Watch out, BD! They don't look friendly.
Watch out, Cal!
Watch out, buddy!
Watch out, gunner down.
Watch out, gunners destroyed.
Watch out.
Watch out. 
Watch out. He's climbed up on that. 
Watch out. Jedi's below. 
Watch out. Jedi's mobile. 
Watch out. No more gunners.
Watch out. Slyyyg here.
Watch out. Slyyyg incoming.
Watch out. That's the last of our ranged support.
Watch the Jedi. 
Watch the enemy. He's dangerous.
Watch the saber!
Watch the target.
Watch the walls. 
Watch this Jedi bleed!
Watch this one!
Watch this one. 
Watch this!
Watch this. 
Watch those movements.
Watch where you aim!
Watch where you're shooting!
Watch where your bolts go!
Watch you crack like the rest of us!
Watch your aim!
Watch your aim. 
Watch your angles. If this Jedi wants to find the tomb here, he will have to defeat us first.
Watch your back!
Watch your backs.
Watch your eyes, friends. 
Watch your eyes. 
Watch your feet!
Watch your feet! We got a scazz.
Watch your feet.
Watch your feet. 
Watch your feet. Scazz.
Watch your fire!
Watch your footing!
Watch your footing. 
Watch your heads!
Watch your heads, mykal are known to swoop down to attack their prey.
Watch your heads.
Watch your step here, Cal. It's not safe.
Watch your step!
Watch your step, Cal.
Watch your surroundings. 
Watch yourself around those skungus. I won't be able to save you next time.
Watch yourself in there.
Watch yourself!
Watch yourself. 
Watch yourselves near him. 
Watch yourselves!
Watch yourselves! He's down there!
Watch yourselves, Brothers. 
Watch yourselves, okay?
Watch yourselves. 
Watch! 
Watch! Slyyyg might charge us.
Watch. 
Watch. Heavy gunner down.
Way before the war.
Way too close.
Way's open. Go!
We ARE pretty quick.
We accomplished our goal.
We actually won? Really?
We adapt.
We all earned this one today. 
We all have our problems. 
We all have the same orders. 
We all helped. 
We always have a choice. But people the Empire has left behind, destroyed, and controlled are depending on us...
We appear to have no more close-range support.
We are Zeffo bound. 
We are alone now.
We are not yet lost.
We are out of fire support.
We are over here.
We are powerful, Brothers!
We are strong enough. He is right. 
We are true assets to the Empire.
We are victorious this day. 
We are waiting.
We barely even scratched the surface. How much of the galaxy have you seen?
We barely made it here!
We barely won...
We believe we can, yes. We can put an end to the oppression of the Empire.
We better check that out.
We better end this fast.
We better. I expected more from a Force-user.
We both have our pride.
We both heard the skirmish. So either everything's fine...
We both survived The Purge.
We can catch him still.
We can do it buddy.
We can do our part. That's it.
We can do this. I promise.
We can end him quickly. 
We can make the galaxy a better place.
We can play this game all day.
We can still win. 
We can talk about it when you get here.
We can win this!
We can win this.
We can win, Brothers. 
We can't allow the Empire to destroy more worlds.
We can't fail.
We can't keep this up!
We can't let any more threats like him through.
We can't let him escape again.
We can't let the sacrifice of those closest to us...
We can't let them get their hands on that much raw energy.
We can't lose, can we?
We can't stop him!
We can't stop him! Shut the door!
We can't stop him! The Jedi took out a flametrooper!
We can't stop now.
We can't stop now. 
We can't win if he keeps recovering.
We can't win this...
We can't win without flametrooper support...
We can't worry about that now - the Empire's identified you as the Jedi from Bracca.
We cannot be defeated. 
We cannot let him destroy us. 
We caught him!
We could build something different.
We could head back to Bogano. Might be more to discover there with your improved skills.
We could optimize our patrol route efficiency by changing postings less frequently.
We could rebuild the Jedi Order and defeat the Empire.
We did it!
We did it.
We did it?
We did swing on it, didn't we? I wonder if there's a way to get it down.
We did. I wouldn't be here without all of you.
We didn't know that it was a walker production outpost going in. Off record. Secret site.
We didn't train for this!
We do. We'll close the ship.
We don't even have to try here.
We don't have any more flametroopers. 
We don't have any other options, and...
We don't have much to worry about here.
We don't have the firepower to breach its hull!
We don't have to be enemies.
We don't know much about Project Auger, but what I do know is that they are here, right now.
We don't know much about this outsider.
We don't like you.
We don't need droid support!
We don't need droids to take you down!
We don't need droids.
We don't need flamethrowers.
We escaped down there. 
We explored many planets. Tombs and temples related to the Zeffo and Jedi.
We finally found it.
We fought hard, but in the end the Empire drove away our allies.
We found a seed!
We found it.
We found the tomb for the Empire and you're here now. Why are we here?
We found what killed them!
We go in together.
We got a mykal.
We got a wyyyschokk here!
We got him!
We got it?
We got more than enough forces to support those areas.
We got no more range trooper power!
We got to slice this door. 
We got to stay on 'em. 
We got your back, Cal.
We gotta get on top of this thing.
We gotta get them out of there.
We gotta hustle, Cal.
We gotta move. Come on.
We gotta run!
We had a... difference of opinion. He thinks the war is lost here.
We had action on how long it would take for you to get here.
We have Tapal pinned at the airlock. Send backup.
We have a special challenger for you tonight.
We have another complication.
We have defeated him. 
We have gained the advantage.
We have much in common.
We have other duties to focus on. 
We have our orders. If the Jedi returns, we are the last line of defense. 
We have our orders. Maintain protocol.
We have our orders. Watch for the outsider.
We have our own mission I can't walk away from. Not yet.
We have sacrified too many, he's too dangerous. We should kill him!
We have the advantage.
We have the same enemy.
We have to end this now. 
We have to fight back.
We have to help them.
We have to help this planet.
We have to protect the guerrilla fighters.
We have to run!
We have to stop him!
We have to stop him.
We have to stop him. 
We have to stop them.
We have to stop this... Jedi. 
We have to take him down quick.
We have to win.
We have training for a reason. 
We have you now.
We haven't had a problem with the Mantis that Greez couldn't fix on the fly.
We heard the Inquisitors were heading to Bracca.
We just better be ready.
We just can't stop him!
We just need to get it in the right position, then open the window across from the waterfall.
We just took down an Inquisitor.
We killed a Jedi.
We killed it?
We killed the Jedi, Brothers!
We knew you'd run.
We know the empire is here, whatever you information you intercept is not going to change our mission.
We lost him!
We lost him.
We lost him. 
We lost over 200 tons of refined sap from the rebel incursion.
We made it, BD.
We made it...
We make a good team, huh?
We make a pretty good team.
We may not have a chance, but we do have loyalty to the Empire. 
We meet again.
We might be able to kill him.
We might.
We must act quickly. I need to inform the Council!
We must all resist, in our own way.
We must attack. 
We must go!
We must not fail them like the many others before us.
We must remain focused. He will return. 
We must remember the mistakes of the past and change things going forward to make sure they never happen again.
We must stay prepared.
We must stop him at all costs. 
We must stop him!
We must stop him. Now. 
We must stop the Jedi. 
We must stop the outsider.
We must survive to control it.
We must take him. 
We must tread carefully. Imperial troopers are still on Zeffo.
We must watch over our brothers.
We need each other to survive. Without the Jedi, I don't know if we can. We have a responsibility to protect them.
We need reinforcements.
We need the Wookiees to win this!
We need to be careful.
We need to be on high alert!
We need to be wary of this one.
We need to call in our report.
We need to do more. 
We need to end this.
We need to end this. 
We need to evacuate!
We need to find another Jedi. 
We need to find the Jedi!
We need to get across this gap.
We need to get it!
We need to get off this ship. Quickly.
We need to help the Jedi!
We need to remove it.
We need to rendezvous with Mari and the others!
We need to rendezvous with Saw.
We need to stop him.
We need to switch to ranged tactics.
We need to take it down!
We need your help!
We never got much support on Lateron when the Empire came rolling through.
We no longer have close quarters support!
We only get one chance at this. Make it count!
We predicted this.
We ready to leave yet?!
We really destroyed those rebels at the cargo pad, huh?
We refit and rebuilt ships.
We scrapped them on Bracca. Every time it felt like picking at the bones of that life.
We see you.
We seek a dangerous fugitive.
We seem to lack any ranged units!
We shall begin with physical preparation.
We shall hunt you down!
We shall run you down.
We shall see.
We should be apprised. We're all on the same side.
We should be manning our posts, not chasing rumors.
We should chase him.
We should check in with the Mantis. Trilla probably knows where they are.
We should follow him down there. Right?
We should get back. Cere and Greez are expecting us.
We should head back down. My face is going numb.
We should inform the other squads.
We should look into this. 
We should not linger here for long.
We should really fix your scomp link.
We should return to camp.
We should switch to ranged only tactics. 
We should take cover.
We should take higher ground.
We shouldn't be here. This place is cursed.
We shouldn't even be out here.
We shouldn't stay here long, Cal. 
We shouldn't stay here long. There are Stormtroopers nearby.
We sneer at you!
We stand here now with a chance to learn.
We still have work to do, Cal.
We still haven't explored Dathomir.
We survived. That's what matters.
We thought it would be easy.
We thought you were dead.
We took it out.
We track Imperial communications.
We trained even as children - it was the way we honored our coven.
We trained for this, do you remember?
We use it.
We used to scrap walkers on Bracca.
We used to sneak out to the swamps and make potions together. We were so close.
We went back and forth after every promising lead brought us to one dead end after another, and one close call after the next.
We were betrayed by those we protected.
We were just talking about the Mantis. It surprisingly grew on me. 
We were kids. We bet all kinds of dumb things from food to funny shaped rocks.
We were peace keepers.
We were trained well by the best. We will succeed. 
We weren't able to fight back but here, with the Wookiees, we have a chance.
We will always struggle.
We will always win. 
We will begin with physical preparation.
We will capture you, traitor!
We will defeat you. 
We will destroy him if he does.
We will destroy the outsider.
We will destroy them all!
We will end you!
We will end you. 
We will find you. 
We will go through.
We will kill the Jedi.
We will never... kneel before you...
We will not be able to fulfill our directive here.
We will not be denied. 
We will pursue you.
We will stand against all outsiders. 
We will wipe out all traitors!
We will. He won't. 
We witnessed a ship crash in the swamps.
We won't be routed.
We won't fare well without rocket troopers. 
We won't leave anyone behind.
We won't leave you.
We won't survive much longer...
We won't win at this rate.
We'd better stay on our toes. Wait, do you... have toes?
We'd go back and forth. Our approaches were completely different.
We'll always find you. 
We'll be fine.
We'll be fine. 
We'll be fine... We'll be fine...
We'll be in touch about Tarfful.
We'll be in touch.
We'll be okay, Greez. We're all here to protect each other.
We'll be okay.
We'll be right behind you.
We'll beat them together.
We'll beat you. 
We'll bleed you dry. 
We'll break your guard.
We'll catch you Jedi!
We'll catch you. Eventually.
We'll defeat you.
We'll end this quick, 
We'll eradicate every fool who thought they could delay our occupation.
We'll find Cordova's holocron.
We'll find them all.
We'll find you a home.
We'll find you again!
We'll find you!
We'll find you. 
We'll find you. You know that, right?
We'll get it back. I promise.
We'll get through. 
We'll get you for that!
We'll get you patched up soon, BD-1.
We'll get you!
We'll get you, Jedi!
We'll get you. 
We'll have to refactor all of our planning documentation.
We'll help, but we need to be careful.
We'll just have to get to it first. 
We'll just wait here until he's surrounded, then move in for the kill.
We'll keep fighting.
We'll kill all of you.
We'll make do with what we've got.
We'll make you pay!
We'll meet up inside, good luck.
We'll need to slice into here.
We'll pick you up when we can.
We'll root you all out. 
We'll see as much as we can, buddy.
We'll send word when we find Tarfful.
We'll stand guard. Good luck in there.
We'll stay here and monitor Imperial transmissions.
We'll stop them. I believe in us.
We'll stop them. Together.
We'll stop you.
We'll take him down easy.
We'll take you down!
We'll take you down, face-to-face.
We'll take you down.
We'll talk later.
We'll try our best. 
We'll vanquish you!
We'll win easy.
We'll wipe out all traitors.
We'll wipe them all out. 
We're Dathomir bound. 
We're about to drop out of hyperspace. Sit down. 
We're about to get paid. 
We're advancing on an Imp landing pad up ahead, wouldn't mind fire support.
We're all doomed!
We're all gonna have to make a choice at some point.
We're all in this together, aren't we?
We're all out of close combat units. 
We're all out of flametrooper support!
We're all out of rocket support now. 
We're almost outta here, I promise.
We're alone now, Jedi. 
We're clear.
We're close.
We're comin' up on our destination.
We're cornered!
We're definitely not on Dathomir anymore.
We're definitely not on Dathomir anymore. 
We're done here.
We're done hiding, Cal.
We're done, get on up here.
We're doomed without a flametrooper. 
We're doomed!
We're friends, understand?
We're getting an encrypted message from Kashyyyk.
We're getting close
We're going to be killed!
We're going to have trouble without flametrooper support. 
We're going to take a beating without rocket troopers. 
We're gonna die!
We're gonna make you pay.
We're gonna need backup...
We're here for each other. Remember that.
We're here to free you.
We're here to help! Keep moving, we'll pick you up ahead
We're here to help.
We're here to work together. Don't doubt the power of a Jedi.
We're hit! Brace yourselves!
We're in pursuit!
We're in this together, always.
We're in trouble. That was our last heavy gunner.
We're in!
We're in.
We're just catching up. 
We're just...
We're lacking close-range specialists.
We're laying low, but the storm's clearing. We won't have any cover soon.
We're leaving Bracca?
We're losing men!
We're making progress. That's good.
We're more than equipped to handle any breach of security.
We're never getting across this gap.
We're next!
We're not alone in this fight, Cal. Difficult or not - it'll happen. It has to.
We're not alone.
We're not doing too bad, huh?
We're not finished yet!
We're not going anywhere, stormtrooper. We have our orders.
We're not safe here.
We're on a time limit here.
We're on high alert.
We're on it!
We're on our way, I promise.
We're on the right track. You already passed one test... Isn't that right, BD-1?
We're out of close-range troops!
We're out of droid support!
We're out of droid support. 
We're out of droid support. Be careful. 
We're out of flamethrower support!
We're out of flamethrower support. 
We're out of flametrooper support.
We're out of flametroopers! Get! Him!
We're out of flametroopers...
We're out of gunners!
We're out of gunners. Watch yourselves. 
We're out of heavy artillery! 
We're out of heavy gunners!
We're out of ranged support!
We're out of ranged troopers. Time to get personal.
We're out of ranged troops, what're we gonna do?!
We're out of rockets.
We're pushing them back!
We're still on this planet, aren't we? Great...
We're taking losses!
We're too much for him. 
We're totally out of close quarters stormtroopers.
We're totally out of flametroopers.
We're totally out of ranged units!
We're trying, Cal. 
We're vulnerable. 
We've almost got him!
We've almost got it!
We've been all over the place; non-stop tour of the Galaxy with her.
We've been in and out of too many dangerous situations to count.
We've been through some tough scrapes. I don't know where she finds the strength to keep going. Especially after -
We've done it!
We've finished him.
We've found a Jedi! Inform HQ!
We've found the Jedi!
We've got a Galaxy to save.
We've got a lively one. 
We've got a phillak here.
We've got a phillak.
We've got a wyyyschokk!
We've got an enemy below!
We've got an injured intruder!
We've got an insurgent. 
We've got an intruder down there.
We've got an intruder here. 
We've got bugs over here!
We've got bugs.
We've got eyes on him!
We've got flame beetles.
We've got him now!
We've got him now.
We've got him!
We've got movement. 
We've got no more close-range guys, we're all gonna die!
We've got no more droid support. 
We've got the cutter!
We've got them on the run, keep pushing!
We've got this buddy.
We've got this!
We've got this, keep moving.
We've got this.
We've got this. Right?
We've got to get this cutter!
We've got to stop him from recovering!
We've got to stop him. 
We've got to take them out. 
We've got wounded up here!
We've gotten weak.
We've lost all gunner support.
We've lost all gunners. 
We've lost all our ranged support!
We've lost all ranged support. Moving to melee tactics. 
We've lost comrades, friends, family... to the Empire.
We've lost contact with several squads.
We've lost crowd control capabilities.
We've lost flametrooper support. Watch yourselves. 
We've lost our ranged backup.
We've managed to recapture some of the escapees, but we'll need more to fill our quotas.
We've nearly got him!
We've scared the outsider away. 
We've trained for scenarios like this.
We've won this round, Captain.
We've... we've got a jotaz!
We... appear to be out of rocket troopers.
We... we better stay on high alert. 
We... we can do it!
We... we did it...
We.... we made it. 
We...should report this. Right?
Weak technique.
Weak trick.
Weak.
Weak. Like the rest of your kind.
Weaken him.
Weakling Jedi...
Weakling!
Weakling. 
Weaklings!
Weaklings! Stop dying!
Wealth isn't really a priority for Jedi.
Weapon power increased.
Weapon's free. 
Weapons at the ready, squad.
Weapons on him!
Wear him down!
Weekly. From now on.
Weird? Maybe. It reminds me we're all connected through the Force.
Weirdo. Huh.
Welcome aboard.
Welcome home, droid.
Welcome home.
Welcome, challenger. 
Welcome.
Well I been a bit busy hauling you around the galaxy.
Well I can just make out a settlement in the middle of it.
Well done squad.
Well done, whoever you are.
Well done.
Well done. 
Well he ain't gonna find that anymore.
Well look at that.
Well no need to be mad at me about it. I didn't steal your blaster.
Well stop it. It's getting on my nerves. 
Well stop it. You aren't funny.
Well, I can handle myself.
Well, I come from the planet Lateron. It's comfortable, small, mostly known for its delicious spices.
Well, I hope you two can sort this thing out soon so we can finish this quest and go relax somewhere.
Well, I was trying to watch... y'know, the... No, I'm not busy. Never busy.
Well, I'd say I'd bet my life on it but I already have...a lot.
Well, I'm glad my fear of a painful death by zombie witches makes you a little bit more at ease.
Well, Trilla...
Well, captain.
Well, he lasted longer than the rest of the Jedi, right?!
Well, if it's all the same to you, I was thinking that maybe I would stick around here and...
Well, it didn't attack us.
Well, no, but a disguise is an essential part of a good heist.
Well, no, but...
Well, no. Not saving the galaxy, but getting knocked down one or twenty times.
Well, she was asking about my ship. Of course I'm gonna show her.
Well, that did something. Let's check it out.
Well, that sounds lovely for you.
Well, that was helpful.
Well, the protection is helpful. Keeps us alive. I'm fine with that. 
Well, there he goes.
Well, they haven't blown us to bits yet. Long as we've got their sap, they can't use explosives.
Well, we couldn't leave the Partisans and Wookiees to die.
Well, with this transformer I bet you can short circuit Imperial tech.
Well, yeah, we followed up alright... right into an Imperial occupied system.
Well, you heard him. Go on...
Well, you know, I'd... I'd like to meet them.
Well, you might be able to find a way up through its root system...
Well--
Well. Guess that's that. 
Well. That's that.
Well. We didn't lose?
Well...
Well... 
Well... you cover me. And I'll run.
Weow be-beep!
Weow bee-bee-beep!
Weow bee-beep!
Weow beep beep!
Weow beep boop!
Weow bo-beep!
Weow boo boop!
Weow de-de-dee!
Weow te-te-dee!
Weow trill!
Weow twooooo!
Weow waaa!
Were seduced...
Were the lives you seek to protect really in danger before you intervened?
Were you aiming for me?
Were you close?
Were you even trying?
Were you hiding this before?
Were you rich growing up?
Weren't you trained?
Wh... What!?
Wha --
Wha- hold, wait, wait a minute. Now, hold on. Now... what is this gonna require?
Wha- she's a witch, isn't she?
Wha- tha-that was the Force, wasn't it?
Wha-...?
Wha-what's happening!?
Wha? Whoa, hey that's- that's a different deck of cards.
Wha?!
What I was.
What Jedi gave their life so that you might live?
What Jedi trick is this?
What Jedi trickery is this?
What a disappointment. Next!
What a dream. 
What a fight!
What a joke.
What a move!
What a racket, huh?
What a score! It's a real scrapper's payday.
What a strike from the Jedi!
What a suck up...
What a waste of training.
What a waste. 
What a weird color pattern.
What about Cordova?
What about disguising the Mantis' signal?
What about for a Jedi?
What about that?
What about you and Trilla?
What are those things? I don't like the look of 'em.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing on Kashyyyk?
What are you doing!?
What are you doing, kid?
What are you doing?
What are you doing? 
What are you doing?!
What are you getting at, Greez?
What are you getting at?
What are you getting at? 
What are you looking at Cere?
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at? 
What are you mumbling about?
What are you muttering about over there?
What are you really doing here, Cal Kestis?
What are you talking about?
What are you thinking about?
What are you thinking?
What are you trying?
What are you waiting for?
What are you...
What can I say? Food always brings people together. Reminds me of my home, my family...
What can you do, BD?
What changed?
What comes next?
What could that be...
What could that be?
What could this be?
What dark magicks are these?
What did he hide inside?
What did he just do?
What did she tell you?
What did that say?
What did we find?
What did you do?
What did you find?
What do I do now!?
What do I do?!
What do the drills have to do with Jedi?
What do they know?
What do we do about those things with the horns?
What do we do if we run into a jotaz?
What do we do without droid support?
What do we know?
What do we think of that?
What do you believe?
What do you know about those ruins?
What do you know?
What do you know?!
What do you mean, Incoming.
What do you mean?
What do you say, Captain?
What do you see when you look at it?
What do you think I'm here for? Get outa here. 
What do you think Saw's planning next?
What do you think of Saw's plan?
What do you think that was?
What do you think the odds are?
What do you think those doors are?
What do you think we'll find?
What do you think, BD-1?
What do you think, BD?
What do you think, Choyyssyk?
What do you think, buddy?
What do you want with Tarfful?
What do you want? I'm not going out there with you.
What do you want? You're up to something. Nothing gets passed old Greezy. I'm watchin'!
What does that mean?
What does the Empire want with tree sap?
What doesn't? You sound like an Imp.
What dread magicks...
What else have you learned?
What empire?
What foul spell is this?
What got you into gambling in the first place? 
What happened between you and Saw?
What happened on Zeffo was a disaster.
What happened to them?
What happened? Are you okay?
What happened? Did you find the Tomb?
What happened?!
What if I screw up, take a fall? I got a family to worry about.
What if Saw's right? What if Kashyyyk can't be won?
What if a whole pack pop up under your feet?
What if they spit at you?
What illusion is this?
What in these ruins tempts you so much...
What intel do you have on the jotaz creature?
What is happening?
What is he doing?
What is it now?
What is it, BD?
What is it, buddy?
What is it?
What is next for us?
What is so special about this spoon? It looks ordinary to me.
What is that thing!?
What is that thing?
What is that?
What is the Force?
What is this place?
What is this!?
What is this?
What is this? Continue excavating! I want rare artifacts, not useless trinkets!
What is this?!
What kind of trick...
What magic is this?
What magicks do we have against them?
What makes you think I want out of here?
What makes you think there are Jedi hiding?
What now, Jedi?
What now?
What now?!
What power is this?
What powers...?
What should we do about krabes?
What showmanship!
What stands in the way becomes the way.
What the...?
What trickery...?
What was in there?
What was inside?
What was it like? 
What was that back there? Was it... was that you?
What was that noise?
What was that sound?
What was that...?
What was that?
What would I do without you?
What would Jaro Tapal say?
What would Jaro Tapal think of you now?
What would he think if he could see his Padawan now?
What would the Empire ever want from this icy wasteland?
What ya got there?
What you were told about the Jedi was not true.
What!?
What!?!
What'd you do, kid? I got dead witches crawling all over my ship!
What'd you find, buddy?
What'd you find?
What'd you know? No security code.
What'd you think flame beetles taste like?
What'd you think it does?
What'd you think, buddy? Should we give these to Greez?
What're you doing down there?
What're you...
What's down there?
What's going on, Greez?
What's going on? Why did they attack you?
What's going to happen?
What's got you so riled up today?
What's happening?
What's happening? Why did the commander just...
What's happening?!
What's he doing?
What's he doing?!
What's he saying?
What's it like hacking other droids anyway?
What's making that noise...?
What's on your mind Merrin?
What's our next destination?
What's over there!?
What's over there?
What's special? How is it that you Nightsisters cast spells, but can't see the magic in the little things?
What's that bud?
What's that noise?
What's that over there?
What's that sound?
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that there? 
What's that up there? A mykal?
What's that, BD-1?
What's that, BD?
What's that?
What's that? 
What's that?!
What's the bounty on Jedi these days anyway?
What's the matter, Jedi? Afraid?
What's the matter? Doubting yourself?
What's the plan? We...
What's the point of doing that?
What's this all about, Greez?
What's this now?
What's this thing? A phillak?
What's this!?
What's this?
What's this? 
What's to know? Destroy all the outsiders.
What's up Greez?
What's up Merrin?
What's up, Greez?
What's up, not gonna follow?
What's wrong, Padawan? Fight not going as planned?
What's wrong, scraprat? Lost your nerve?
What's your favorite place you can't ever go back to now?
What's your name, little droid?
What's your secret?
What's...happening...
What, like some kind of war hero?
What, no way! It's always fighting with you. Forget I said anything.
What, you want a medal?
What... is this?
What... is... happening?
What... what did he do?
What?
What? 
What? Afraid of a little heat?
What? Did you hear something? Something moving near me? If it's not behind glass, I hate nature...
What? Don't want all the glory for yourself?
What? Gonna report me again?
What? I can pronounce Zeffo, who says I can't?
What? I was gonna say they'd get a stern talking to.
What? I'm busy admiring my ship? Do you mind? 
What? I'm not.
What? Is this a trick question? You want me to go outside and find her for you?
What? It helps to talk about it, right? No?
What? Keep that droid at a distance, I don't want it leaking on me or whatever.
What? No, no, no, I don't need him fixing nothing. You keep your scomps off my ship.
What? None for me?
What? Sorc Tormo?
What? Spit it out, stormtrooper!
What? That's not good.
What? That's not good. 
What? Too much for you?
What? What is this?
What? What's that thing saying? I don't know why people have droids.
What? Who's there?
What? Why would I ever do that? No. I'm not going out there. What do you want, Cal?
What? You've never seen a terrarium before?
What?!
What?! Agh! No!
What?! Intruder!
What?! No!
What?! O-of course I was there, in the back.
What??
Whatever civilization crafted this must be the same that created the seemingly impenetrable structure nearby!
Whatever comes next, I think she can handle it. 
Whatever completes our orders to the letter.
Whatever destroyed that Venator must've been powerful.
Whatever gets the job done. I have no other interest otherwise.
Whatever happens in there and whatever you see...
Whatever his end game was, I'm glad we put a stop to it. 
Whatever it takes?
Whatever keeps you alive, I guess.
Whatever neutralizes the threat, trooper.
Whatever she's doing, it's working.
Whatever that was...it's gone.
Whatever you say. Hey, we should get back down.
Whatever. Thing scares the heck outta me. You miss it?
When I find you...
When I found Greez, he was in a lot of debt with the Brood. I paid it off. All of it... at least I thought so.
When I get down...
When I know for a fact that it won't kill me, eat me, get me sick, accidentally grow me a fifth arm...
When I meditate, if I let my guard down...
When I saw it for the first time I was almost as small as you.
When I was a Padawan I thought Cordova and I had explored the whole galaxy.
When does Greez take care of this thing? I've never seen him do it.
When faced with the choice to protect herself or her Padawan, she chose self-interest.
When he said bring seeds, I hope he meant from Dathomir.
When he told me the Jedi slaughtered my sisters, I was no longer alone. Anger became my companion.
When it's out there, you betcha.
When the Purge started and our...
When the war came to this world.
When there were Jedi.
When this is all over, I think it'll be time to settle down, you know? Fall in love, start a family.
When this is over, what do you think Merrin's going to do?
When we first brought you here, when you proved yourself to be the one we were looking for,
When we first came to Zeffo, I wasn't sure how far we'd go.
When we first met, I didn't really take you as the caring about plants kind of guy.
When will you learn to take a compliment?
When you face one Nightsister of Dathomir - 
When you want to go, let me know. I'll be right here.
When you want to go, let me know. I'll be right here. 
When you've already lost yourself...
Where I come from, if you ain't tough, you better act tough. But Jumbaco, he was one of the good ones. Not a great gambler though.
Where I least expected.
Where a-are we?
Where are they now?
Where are they?
Where are we?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?!
Where are you hiding?
Where are you taking us?!
Where are you, Jedi?
Where are you, outsider?
Where are you, traitor?
Where are you, vermin!?
Where are you?
Where are you? We can't wait for you any longer. I'm sorry.
Where are you?! Come here!
Where did he go now?
Where did he go?
Where did you come from?
Where did you escape to?
Where did you go?
Where did you last see him?
Where do you consider home?
Where do you want to go, buddy?
Where do your people come from?
Where is he?
Where is that coming from?
Where is the Force?
Where is the target located?
Where is this Jedi?
Where is this Jedi? This location is lifeless.
Where is your family?
Where is your power, Jedi?
Where is your skill?
Where should we go next?
Where the Inquisitors come from.
Where they take Jedi.
Where they tortured Cere and turned Trilla to the dark side.
Where to go, where to go?
Where to next, Cal?
Where to next?
Where to next? Let the Force guide you.
Where to now...? Hey, wait up!
Where to, kid?
Where we headed?
Where you going?
Where your holocron waits, hidden?
Where'd he go?
Where'd that thing come from?
Where'd that wyyyschokk come from!?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go? 
Where'd you learn that?
Where's the fun in that?
Where's this power coming from?
Where...?
Where? Where? I'll look!
Wherever here is.
Whether it's a course of action or an idea... We all have to be ready to change.
Whether there is or there isn't, we are not tasked to question the orders of the Empire. Understood, stormtrooper?
Which fight is it this time?
Which is probably why I'm so bad at talking my way out of trouble. 
Which planet next...
Which report?
Who am I? I'm Sorc Tormo, baby.
Who are you people?
Who are you talking to?
Who are you?
Who are you?!
Who cares about an ancient tomb anyway?
Who cares.
Who cares? This planet's ours now.
Who did that? Who's there?
Who else wants a turn?
Who goes there?
Who goes there? Aah!
Who has time for that?
Who is that?
Who should I kill first? The Latero or the human?
Who taught you that?
Who taught you to cook anyway?
Who trained you?
Who was she?
Who was that back there?
Who was your master, Padawan?
Who'd want it pushing them around all the time?
Who's back there?
Who's making that noise?
Who's over there?
Who's over there?! Come out!
Who's ready to fight some Imps?
Who's that?
Who's there!
Who's there!?
Who's there?
Who's there? 
Who's there? Oh, Cal. Are we ready to go?
Who's there?!
Who's this now?
Who...
Who... what?
Who... who's there?
Who...?
Whoa - whoa. No one said we're friends.
Whoa --
Whoa there!
Whoa!
Whoa! Guess a lightsaber can't solve everything.
Whoa! Ha - cheap shot, Commander!
Whoa! How do you do that, anyway?
Whoa, a Venator? Those things are seriously built, not easy to take down.
Whoa, haha!
Whoa, nice jets!
Whoa, thanks! All that information's bound to come in handy.
Whoa, they're beautiful.
Whoa, we filled all your stim slots? That's great!
Whoa, whoa, slow down. It's a plant growing competition, not a plant gathering competition.
Whoa, whoa, whoa and you're leading them HERE?!
Whoa, whoa, you're just realizing that? Where have you been, I mean, it doesn't get better than me.
Whoa, whoa. You know what this means?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-wait!
Whoa.
Whoa. All right. 
Whoa. And if they do? We can't take the Empire head-on.
Whoa. Be careful. 
Whoa. That's gotta be one of the Zeffo. 
Whoa. Watch for walls. 
Whoa. Watch it.
Whoa. Watch it. 
Whoaaa! It's on!
Whoaaaaa!
Whoah hey!
Whoah no!
Whoah!
Whoah, see that, BD?
Whoah, whoah one thing at a time. First maintenance, then flight lessons. Maybe. I haven't committed to anything yet.
Whoah.
Whoah. Tell me we're not running that blockade.
Whoever flew this went down in a blaze of glory.
Whoever lived here used this room for storage. They kept food and supplies.
Whoever locked me up took my lightsaber. Gotta get it back.
Whoever owned this bag brought it from Coruscant!
Whole unit eradicated.
Whoo!
Whoo! Good fight!
Whoo! Got him!
Whoo, almost got that nice face of yours knocked in.
Whoo-whooooo.
Whoo.
Whooboo!
Whooboop?
Whoooaaaaa!
Whoop-whoop!
Whoops!
Whoops. 
Whose lives?
Why are we even still here? There's nothing on this planet!
Why are you creeping around my ship?
Why are you doing that?
Why are you even trying?
Why are you running?
Why are you walking like that?
Why can't I move?
Why can't any of you go look?
Why did you run away when we encountered the last group of insurgents?
Why didn't she just tell me about Trilla? We were supposed to be a team.
Why didn't you stop me?
Why do you feel the need to try and teach people. Krabe this. Krabe that.
Why do you say that?
Why do you seek this thing?
Why do you think that is?
Why do you try?
Why don't you want to take this fight?
Why must they die so quickly?
Why not?
Why recover?
Why should I cover you?
Why ya runnin'!
Why'd you help me?
Why'd you stop?
Why're you running?
Why's that?
Why?
Why? Because of all the arms? 
Why? We can take down a jotaz if we stand together!
Why?!
Will have to earn it.
Will not falter.
Will suffer.
Will the Jedi make it?!
Will we find the Jedi in there?
Will you let me?
Will you look at that - a Separatist ship.
Wind shafts? I wonder if we can open them.
Winged him!
Wiping out the pest.
Wish I could help with that, but I've got... mess hall duty.
Wish I could say the same for the others who tried to land here.
Wish I could say the same for this creature though.
With a bit of luck we'll intercept any distress calls.
With all your sisters gone, who taught you to wield magick?
With each moment I am challenged, but I appreciate the support.
With each other.
With me! After the intruder!
With me.
With my terrarium built out I can finally get holos for Galactic Botanist's competition!
With persistence and the Force as my ally...
With right calibration, a blaster could pass right through Mandalorian armor.
With that list of Force-sensitives...
With the dead.
With the defenses they got our usual tricks just aren't gonna cut it.
With the project suspended, do you think we'll be reassigned?
With their leadership, we'll destroy the Jedi once and for all.
With this, you and I are gonna be unstoppable!
Within their glyphs, I've determined the words Sage, Vault, and Tomb.
Without any... purpose. Just hiding.
Wo-wah be bo ba bee!
Wo-wah be-be-bee!
Wo-wah be-dee boo!
Wo-wah bee doo!
Wo-wah bo-bo-boo!
Wo-wah trill bee!
Woah now. It'll get better. Eventually. 
Woah!
Woah! Heads down!
Woah! It's coming for us!
Woah! Scazz here!
Woah! Watch out!
Woah, woah, who's this?
Woah. BD-1!
Woah. Careful. 
Woah. Keep steady. 
Woah. What's this?
Woah? A slyyyg? Right?
Won't be locked for long. 
Won't be much of a fight.
Won't be much of fight...
Won't be soon enough.
Won't block this. 
Won't catch me, Jedi. 
Won't catch them all. 
Won't dodge this. 
Won't evade this!
Won't get me.
Won't get me. 
Won't happen. 
Won't hit me!
Won't kill me. 
Won't matter.
Won't open from this side.
Won't save you. 
Won't shake me!
Won't stop me. 
Wonder how we get inside.
Wonder if Greez can cook with these?
Wonder what that was...
Wonder what these will turn into?
Wonder where we should go next...
Woo!
Woo! Bet they didn't see that coming.
Woo.. beep?
Woo...
Wooaaah, wait a minute, hold on, wait a minute.
Wooar. Waa.
Wookiee warriors left this. They used this place as a hideout in their battle against the Empire.
Wookiees have been enslaved...
Wooo!
Wooo...
Wooo... Be-beep.
Wooo....
Woooo!
Woooo...
Woooo....
Wooooo!
Wooooooooo!
Woooooooooo!
Woop!
Work harder. 
Worried or something?
Worried?
Worried? 
Worse - it carried an Inquisitor. The Ninth Sister.
Worthless resistance. 
Would they have recognized you?
Would you believe I made some poor life choices?
Would you take a look at that?
Wouldn't be alive today if we weren't.
Wouldn't hurt to throw some art on the walls. Something new to look at.
Wouldn't mind it myself.
Wounded target found. 
Wow!
Wow, okay. I was just joking.
Wow, that's better.
Wow, you're slow!
Wow. That's very impressive. I'm honored to fight alongside you.
Wow... I won.
Wraaaaugh. Wraa raaaaaaaaa.
Wraaar-rwooow.
Wretched legged crawling cowards!
Wroaaaaar!
Wrooa. Waaaaagh!
Wrooaaaaaa! Rawgh!
Wrooo! Waarrh.
Wroooooar!
Wrooooooar!
Wrrroar Raaaor.
Wyyyschokk approaching! Repeat, wyyyschokk approaching.
Wyyyschokk approaching. 
Wyyyschokk call Kashyyyk home. They are often referred to as vicious, horrifying, and intelligent species.
Wyyyschokk here!
Wyyyschokk here.
Wyyyschokk here?
Wyyyschokk!
Wyyyschokk! Don't get trapped!
Wyyyschokk! Right here!
Wyyyschokk.
Wyyyschokk. Finally, a challenging foe.
XT-1220 was there! He saw the Jedi. 
Y'know it's not the Origin Tree or anything, but it does the job.
Y'know, you're a... you're welcome, kid. But uh, I gotta go. I got a thing. So. Gotta... see ya.
Y-yes, sir!
Y-you're mine!
Ya afraid?
Ya can't stop em all!
Ya caught me!
Ya feelin' okay? 
Ya know, even after all the action you two bring, I still get a thrill watching the games.
Ya know, my piloting hasn't been this good since I graduated first in my class at the Lateron Space Academy.
Ya lost 'em!
Ya slippery...
Ya'll okay over there?
Yeah back off!
Yeah buddy, I see it.
Yeah but they're incredibly old. Can't tell much from them.
Yeah it whets my appetite.
Yeah you will, just in a different way.  
Yeah!
Yeah! 
Yeah! Creature down!
Yeah! Get him!
Yeah! Got him!
Yeah! I got him!
Yeah! It's a reminder to keep fighting.
Yeah! Maybe I'll teach her how to gamble. I'm sure a witch sister...
Yeah! Someone else take a hit!
Yeah! That thing's dead!
Yeah! We all have our dreams, okay. Let me have mine.
Yeah! You better run!
Yeah, BD and I got this.
Yeah, Greez. You could definitely show her some strange new wonders.
Yeah, I better go.
Yeah, I can't jump that high.
Yeah, I did alright. 
Yeah, I felt the same way.
Yeah, I gotta line this one up just right.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I guess we do.
Yeah, I know. Can't help it if I'm gorgeous, Cal. Burdened with the curse of beauty my entire life.
Yeah, I like the sound of that.
Yeah, I see it too.
Yeah, I see it.
Yeah, I snuck into a tour group wearing a disguise.
Yeah, I think I'm all right. 
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I think that's all of them.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Yeah, I understand that.
Yeah, I was poor too, but it wasn't so bad. My crew and I would find things to do for cheap.
Yeah, I wish there was another way.
Yeah, I'd feel weird about hacking people too.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Yeah, I'm alright.
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
Yeah, I'm good.
Yeah, I'm great.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Yeah, I'm okay. Just... brings back memories.
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks to you.
Yeah, I'm okay. You alright?
Yeah, I'm thinking about turning it down. I feel like I can do more damage on the front lines. 
Yeah, I've been. It's horrible what happened.
Yeah, a complication we could have avoided.
Yeah, all there is to worry about is the local fauna. But you can just avoid them.
Yeah, almost close to death. I slipped up. I gave myself away. I drew the Inquisition to me.
Yeah, alright.
Yeah, anytime!
Yeah, better do this by the book.
Yeah, but I'm ready.
Yeah, but he won't be getting through.
Yeah, but that was hours ago.
Yeah, can you believe she's never tried Moof Juice or witnessed a fight between two Dugs in a cantina,
Yeah, doesn't seem like the sort of music that that Cordova would be into.
Yeah, far. Yeah.
Yeah, heh.
Yeah, it really helped. Thanks, BD.
Yeah, it was a prison riot.
Yeah, it was new... back in the day. You probably don't get around that area much.
Yeah, it's a stim module. Do you want it?
Yeah, it's for the Empire... but also for myself. I love this job. 
Yeah, it's incredible.
Yeah, just don't get hit.
Yeah, kinda like you.
Yeah, let's check it out.
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah, let's move on. We can always come back here later.
Yeah, listen to the Nightsister. Gonna take a hard pass on that one, kid.
Yeah, maybe there.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, maybe. When Cere first picked me up for this thing, I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into. 
Yeah, nice try.
Yeah, no other way. Still, I hate to see them ruin it.
Yeah, now you're thinking. Let's get outta here.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay. All I wanted to say was thanks.
Yeah, skungus got in his quarters somehow. Nearly blew him up.
Yeah, something's going on.
Yeah, that figures.
Yeah, that thing, but we've been together awhile and I barely heard anything.
Yeah, that's good to know. 
Yeah, that's right. I still am, and you better make sure that witch lady knows it too. 
Yeah, the Mantis is my ship but you better pay attention to this lady here.
Yeah, the wind's strong here. Wonder why?
Yeah, there were some Purge Troopers at the refinery. They're deadly.
Yeah, there's your confidence again. You know, kid, if I had your confidence, I'd be king of the galaxy.
Yeah, they're an... ugly group, huh?
Yeah, they've been tailing us for a while now. The Haxion Brood put a steep price on my head. And they're not the biggest fan of Greez either.
Yeah, this tomb might rise up too.
Yeah, those were the days.
Yeah, time to look for more spheres.
Yeah, we can help it but we have to be careful. I don't want to spook it.
Yeah, we haven't seen each other since a few hours ago.
Yeah, we scared him off.
Yeah, we'll see how much you learn.
Yeah, well, I understand.
Yeah, well, they're a pain in my palms trimming 'em every day.
Yeah, well. It comes with experience. You can't look this good and not steal a few hearts.
Yeah, well... what are ya gonna do. That's what my great-grandma always said.
Yeah, yeah good to see you too. This place is a dump.
Yeah, yeah, very funny. 
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. You've said that. As long as she doesn't try anything funny, we'll be fine. 
Yeah, you could say that. Didn't really have the most wealthy upbringing, so...
Yeah, you got up close and personal, right?
Yeah, you helped a lot, buddy.
Yeah, you should start playing again.
Yeah, you're alright.
Yeah, you're going down!
Yeah, you're quick. 
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah, you're right. I think I could replace yours with this.
Yeah, you're right. Thanks for keeping an eye out.
Yeah, you're right. We can do this.
Yeah, you've mentioned that before. Any luck?
Yeah.
Yeah. (straining)
Yeah. Aged worse'n you did, though!
Yeah. Be careful.
Yeah. Cept, it was crawling with Imperials. And heavy artillery, walkers everywhere...
Yeah. Good to hear your voice, Cere.
Yeah. Hey, maybe when we train the Younglings, we'll do it my way.
Yeah. I believe in you too, buddy.
Yeah. I found his body.
Yeah. I hear you.
Yeah. I'd be even more excited.
Yeah. I'll try the leg. 
Yeah. I'm great. Thank you, Greez.
Yeah. It has. Not a bad sign.
Yeah. Maybe I am. Learned from the best. 
Yeah. Not a bad idea.
Yeah. Not uncommon. Lateron was prone to attacks by gangsters now and then.
Yeah. Seeker Greez!
Yeah. She likes you, too.
Yeah. Stay down. 
Yeah. Still, it's worth checking.
Yeah. That's the Mantis. Not too bad, huh? Hasn't broken down yet. 
Yeah. We'll handle it together.
Yeah. We're talking pure entertainment. Nothing gets me going more than watching a couple a slubs square off.
Yeah. Weird to be back like this.
Yeah. Well, she's not one to tell you everything.
Yeah. Yeah I'm fine. 
Yeah. Yeah I'm okay.
Yeah. Yeah we can do it.
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, Cal.
Yeah. Yeah. You've said that before and...
Yeah. You and me, we're unstoppable together.
Yeah. You can tell they are afraid. It's sad that things have gotten this bad.
Yeah. You think I'm going out there?
Yeah...
Yeah... I guess so, but I'm not the one risking my neck out there.
Yeah... I guess so.
Yeah... I suppose so.
Yeah... Yeah, I had that.
Yeah... ages.
Yeah... got added last week.
Yeah... it's all they really allowed me to do.
Yeah... it's hard to look at these crystals after everything we went through.
Yeah... they can't hide forever.
Yeah... we have coffins for a reason, too.
Yeah... well, okay, sure there are still some things to fix, but that's because I'm busy, I'm building a new hyperdrive.
Yeah... well, someone's gotta. This ship isn't full of the most cheery bunch, ya know.
Yeah... yeah I'm okay.
Yeah... you better run!
Yeah...I lost her a long time ago. 
Yeah...yeah let's finish this. 
Yeah? And what would that be?
Yeah? I need to settle the sphere in front of that middle wind shaft.
Yeah? Let me see. 
Yeah? Thanks, Cal.
Yeah? You think a guy like me doesn't know love?
Years ago Jedi Master Chiata's ship disappeared in this sector, but was never found. It's possible that could be it.
Years ago.
Years on this rock and no artifacts to show for it.
Yeesh!
Yeesh! This whole forest is alive.
Yep, there you go.
Yep.
Yep. 
Yep. Here we are scrapping these ships from the war just so they can turn around and make new ones.
Yes I'm sure. Now eyes up and keep steady. 
Yes sir!
Yes sir.
Yes!
Yes! Be afraid!
Yes! Burn the chaff!
Yes! Fight me!
Yes! Flee! And don't return!
Yes! Let's take a look.
Yes! More power!
Yes! Move in on him!
Yes! Power!
Yes! Resist!
Yes! Show me some power!
Yes! Show me your power. 
Yes! Strengthen yourself!
Yes! Yes!
Yes, Brother.
Yes, I just... I need some space.
Yes, I see. 
Yes, Jedi!
Yes, Jedi! Again!
Yes, Master.
Yes, Master?
Yes, Second Sister.
Yes, bleed...
Yes, but instead of opening up, I push it back down.
Yes, flee coward!
Yes, get him!
Yes, kill him!
Yes, let's get this over with.
Yes, most dangerous and wicked.
Yes, okay. 
Yes, patch yourself.
Yes, she kept me awake all night.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir! Sorry, sir!
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. 
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I am prepared and ready.
Yes, that's it.
Yes, the path is difficult.
Yes, this is for you. But I need to install it.
Yes, understood.
Yes, we are.
Yes, with the Force.
Yes, you would have died.
Yes.
Yes. 
Yes. All outsiders must know.
Yes. Alright. Got it. 
Yes. And so are you, I've seen it. You've learned a lot from all this, Cal.
Yes. But beware: if you're lying, you will join Malicos.
Yes. Dathomir is intricate; its ancient power emanates from the shadows.
Yes. I suppose we do. 
Yes. It was difficult, but you must cope, not forget.
Yes. Let's keep it that way. 
Yes. My magick is exactly like eating steak.
Yes. Show me your skill. 
Yes. Some magick requires it.
Yes. They are given by our mothers and symbolize our bond with the coven.
Yes. They're Jedi sent to find and retrieve young Force-sensitives. Like the ones on that holocron. I was a Seeker.
Yes. Try to resist. 
Yes. Understood. And if he doesn't come, well, least we all get to live another day, right? 
Yes. Yes, this is what I want. 
Yes. You know it?
Yes. You think they give those for that?
Yes. You're ready to face your past.
Yes...
Yet here one stands.
Yet you do?
Yet you surround yourself with a crew.
Yet, Cordova chose to spend a lot of time here. 
Yikes.
Yikes...
You ARE a Jedi!
You Jedi folk, you turn into the Force or somethin' when you die, so what are you afraid of?
You Jedi love going from one problem to the next. Don't you ever get sick of it?
You Jedi should focus on doing rather than talking.
You actually hit me!
You agreed to guard this secret, at the cost of your own memories. I will never forget that sacrifice.
You all did good work today.
You alright, BD?
You always find a way, eh kid?
You always find good things.
You and Merrin getting along?
You and me now, Jedi. 
You and me.
You annoying insect!
You answered quick.
You are a coward!
You are a disappointment.
You are a failure.
You are a skilled fighter. 
You are a threat and must be stopped.
You are a true challenge. 
You are a weakling. 
You are going to build a new one.
You are mad, Malicos.
You are mine, trespasser. 
You are mine.
You are mine. 
You are no Jedi.
You are not approved trash.
You are not my equal in the Force.
You are not powerful enough. 
You are not worthy.
You are nothing. 
You are one brave droid. 
You are ready.
You are slow for a Jedi!
You are slow!
You are so very weak. 
You are spineless!
You are still a frail child.
You are such a poor excuse for a soldier.
You are weak!
You are weak, outsider. 
You are weak. 
You are.
You aren't getting away!
You aren't leaving here alive.
You aren't quick enough. 
You aren't sneaky up there. 
You aren't sneaky, Jedi!
You aren't so skilled!
You aren't so skilled.
You aren't so smooth. 
You aren't so tough.
You aren't tough. 
You aren't trying!
You aren't welcome here. 
You barely stopped me.
You beast!
You betcha.
You better be right. 
You better drop me.
You better get going, Cal.
You better get going, Cal. Time's always important but with Empire here...
You better get going, Cal. Time's always important but with the Empire here...
You better get moving. There's a lot to learn here. Good luck.
You better help me!
You better hope not.
You better not come back!
You better watch my back. 
You bleed like all the others. 
You bore me!
You bore me.
You bore us.
You both shall learn.
You calling me?
You can barely compete with me.
You can do this. Just like Jumbaco Ridge.
You can do this. Try again.
You can kill it by shooting it. That's all you need to know.
You can make it work.
You can read the past? Can all Jedi do this?
You can reflect, huh?
You can say that again!
You can see an object in their hand.
You can take a hit!
You can't avoid us forever. 
You can't beat me.
You can't beat the Empire!
You can't beat us all.
You can't beat us.
You can't bind me.
You can't block forever!
You can't block forever. 
You can't block us all.
You can't break me. 
You can't break through.
You can't catch them all!
You can't catch them all. 
You can't compete.
You can't defeat the Empire.
You can't ditch me.
You can't dodge forever!
You can't elude me. 
You can't escape me. 
You can't escape the Brood. 
You can't escape the Empire. 
You can't escape us!
You can't escape!
You can't escape.
You can't escape. 
You can't even walk into a place without whispers muttering your name. 
You can't get away. 
You can't get me. 
You can't hide down there. 
You can't hide from the Empire.
You can't hide up there forever. 
You can't hide.
You can't hold forever!
You can't keep hiding!
You can't keep that up.
You can't keep this up forever.
You can't keep this up.
You can't know everything, you can only trust that you are able to handle whatever you face.
You can't match me!
You can't match me.
You can't match my speed.
You can't match us!
You can't overpower us.
You can't prevail now!
You can't resist me!
You can't run forever!
You can't run forever.
You can't run forever. 
You can't run from me!
You can't run from the Empire!
You can't run from us.
You can't say I didn't warn you.
You can't stand against me. 
You can't stand against us. 
You can't stand against... us. 
You can't stay down there.
You can't stop me forever. 
You can't stop me!
You can't stop the Brood. 
You can't stop the Empire.
You can't stop them all.
You can't stop this!
You can't stop us all!
You can't stop us!
You can't stop us.
You can't tilt me, Jedi!
You can't top my skill.
You can't topple me.
You can't touch me.
You can't vanquish me.
You can't win!
You can't win! Accept it!
You can't win, Jedi. 
You can't win, outsider. 
You can't win, traitor. 
You can't win.
You can't win. 
You cannot avoid death forever!
You cannot block forever
You cannot break me!
You cannot bypass this outpost.
You cannot defeat me!
You cannot defeat me.
You cannot defeat me. 
You cannot defeat our might. 
You cannot defeat the Empire!
You cannot defeat the Force!
You cannot defy me!
You cannot dodge everything. 
You cannot end me!
You cannot escape me. 
You cannot escape the Nightbrothers. 
You cannot escape!
You cannot escape.
You cannot hide your weakness. 
You cannot hide.
You cannot hope to win. 
You cannot impede me.
You cannot prevail. 
You cannot resist!
You cannot run forever!
You cannot run forever. 
You cannot run. 
You cannot stand against us. 
You cannot stand before my skill!
You cannot stand before us!
You cannot stop me!
You cannot stop me. No one can!
You cannot stop us all!
You cannot stop us!
You cannot win!
You cannot win, intruder. 
You cannot win.
You cannot win. 
You catch on fast. When you're ready to find Tarfful, that's the way to go.
You caught me!
You caught me. 
You chose the wrong stormtrooper. 
You chose to return.
You continue to fail.
You could put in for a transfer.
You could say that. 
You could say that. I don't know much about ancient cultures like you and Cere,
You couldn't have won. 
You coward!
You crossed the wrong family. 
You daydreaming or something wrong with your equipment?
You detect anything weird, BD?
You did good here, kid. I bet they appreciate it.
You did good work on Bogano.
You did good, Cal. We might not've found Tarfful yet, but you saved lives today. Don't forget that.
You did it.
You did the right thing. Any Jedi would be proud to see their blade protecting others.
You didn't? Ugh... great. I lost it again. I made it, you know? 
You do not scare me!
You don't belong here!
You don't concern me.
You don't have real power.
You don't have to die. Join me!
You don't have to tell me twice.
You don't know that. 
You don't know the half of it, kid.
You don't like that idea?
You don't scare me.
You don't scare me. 
You don't seem as scared as you were before.
You don't seem ready.
You don't think they put... you know...
You don't wanna end up like me.
You don't.
You don't... no, no one to fear. No.
You don't?
You done?
You encountered a Dathomirian bat? And you survived?
You ever heard of it?
You ever heard of the E Chu Ta, BD?
You ever win?
You face us all!
You fail to impress!
You failure!
You fear me, don't you?
You fear our might. 
You fear us.
You feel its history.
You feelin' okay?
You feeling okay, Greez?
You felt this yet you've continued deepening your connection to the Force. You know what that says to me?
You find the holocron.
You find your Wookiee?
You flee?! Coward!
You flew freighters in circles?
You fool!
You fool.
You fought in the Clone Wars, did you not?
You fought well.
You found it.
You get that off a corpse?
You get the hang of it quick.
You go get him!
You go to cantinas?
You gonna hit me? C'mon!
You got it out of me. That's why I could never be a Jedi.
You got it!
You got it, Prauf.
You got it.
You got lucky, handsome.
You got me!
You got this, BD. 
You got this, kid.
You gotta move on and live your life.
You gotta quit messin' with me, Cal. I'm tough but fragile.
You gotta take on more jobs, can't just sit here collecting a paycheck.
You had no chance.
You had no idea that was there, did you? 
You had to know it wouldn't end well with gangsters like the Haxion Brood.
You have Greezy Four-Arms to thank for bringing us together.
You have any idea WHO that was?
You have eyes on?
You have failed me, Inquisitor.
You have grown more powerful...
You have let down your master.
You have no idea what a Seeker is, do you?
You have no right to Dathomir.
You have no right to mention his name.
You have nothing to worry about.
You have nowhere to run.
You have passed the test I left behind.
You have sealed your fate.
You have some skill.
You have to deal with me now, Jedi. 
You have to mess up.
You have your training. Trust it. 
You haven't gotten away yet.
You haven't trained enough.
You hear that garbage?
You hear that? He said he needs my help.
You heard about what happened at the dig site?
You heard it too?
You hesitate!
You hitched a ride?
You holdin' up okay?
You holding up over there, Captain?
You hung with a pretty tough crowd before Cere picked you up.
You hungry?
You just need to shoot the little monsters faster.
You just wanted to turn that cutter on.
You just wrecked a perfectly good walker.
You kiddin' me? Ain't no prize worth scuffin' up this gorgeous mug.
You knew him?
You know I'm not one to back down from a fight.
You know Tarfful?
You know binary? You never told me that!
You know check-ins are standard procedure here! This is our biggest assignment yet, don't risk losing it!
You know he's wrong about you... naive.
You know it!
You know the price for disobeying our leader!
You know the work I put into this ship?
You know this is pointless.
You know what power is? A good blaster. That's power.
You know what that means, BD-1?
You know what you need to do to start healing, and I'm so proud of you for that.
You know what? Don't tell me. Why did I even ask? Leave me alone, I got to decide on what my final meal is going to be. 
You know you can't escape!
You know you can't get away?
You know you cannot win.
You know, BD. I'm not too bad of a cook.
You know, Cere believes in you. To tell you the truth, I didn't really think that much of you at first.
You know, I was a Jedi.
You know, I've been alone for... a while now.
You know, are they spicy? Because of the, uh... the fire.
You know, ship flying's a complicated art... but that's only if I stick around. 
You know, small talk. It's nothing. I'm a... What, I'm checking on you, actually. (clears throat) Are you okay?
You know, these guys... they've been through almost as much as we have. 
You know, we'd be a lot more secure in this position with a couple of Purge Troopers for backup.
You know, when I first got the Mantis some called it a piece of junk.
You know, you don't have to compliment me all the time. 
You know, you never told me how you became a Jedi.
You know, you try to keep a place clean and then you guys bring me here. Place smells like damp Wookiee fur.
You lack conviction. 
You lack discipline. 
You lack finesse!
You lack finesse. 
You lack focus.
You lack focus. 
You lack power!
You lack proper training!
You lack technique!
You lack training. 
You let fear break your connection to the Force.
You let me die, padawan!
You let me know when you're ready to go and I'm right behind you.
You like getting upgrades, BD?
You live for this, huh?
You look finished, Jedi.
You look hurt Jedi. 
You look hurt!
You look hurt. Just give up. 
You look small. 
You look weak, Jedi. 
You lost your lightsaber.
You lured me here. Was this your plan all along?
You made a big mistake, Jedi!
You made a big mistake. 
You made a mistake coming here. 
You made a mistake!
You made a mistake. 
You made a mistake. Jedi!
You made it.
You made your choice. I get it. Doesn't change what we have to do.
You make a good team.
You make sure of that. 
You make that look easy.
You making friends with Saw's fighters?
You mapped everywhere we've been!
You mean that or you just giving me a hard time?
You mean the damage to the excavation site?
You mean with the Force?
You might be right for once. That said, we have our orders.
You might be right. I'm starting to wonder if I heard anything at all.
You mind? We're having a moment over here.
You missed a spot. 
You missed. 
You more afraid of the wildlife here or the Haxion Brood?
You move too slowly!
You must activate it if we're to escape.
You must be a Nightsister.
You must catch him off-guard.
You must have come here a lot with Cordova.
You must ignore all distraction.
You must... (struggles)
You need more training.
You need more training. 
You need practice. 
You need to move, fast.
You need to stop him!
You never came here with Cordova, right?
You never fail to amaze me, buddy.
You never stood a chance.
You okay there?
You okay, BD?
You okay, Prauf?!
You okay?
You only delay the inevitable!
You only delay the inevitable.
You only delay your death.
You only delay your destruction. 
You only delay your end. 
You only delay. 
You only impede me!
You only prolong the inevitable.
You only prolong this. 
You overstep your bounds.
You passed the test.
You picked the wrong fight.
You ready for a swim, BD?
You ready to clear out some riffraff, stormtrooper?
You ready to die?
You ready to do this?
You ready to fight, Jedi?
You ready to head to the Fortress?
You really saved me, BD.
You really think we can do this?
You really wanna go to Ilum? Okay. 
You reek of weakness!
You rely on someone else to keep you alive, you don't get to do anything other than grow, you can't really defend yourself.
You remember me. I came to Bogano looking for my former Master, Eno Cordova.
You risked them for me?
You said it. 
You saved our necks in there. Thank you.
You saw something in there.
You saw that too... right?
You see him?
You see something move back there, rookie?
You see something?
You see that?
You see this Star Destoyer? It's a Venator.
You see, Padawan? I have focus.
You seem happy.
You seem quite confident in your beliefs.
You seem uncertain.
You seem worried.
You seen what the Empire has done to Kashyyyk.
You shall not hit me.
You should be hunting.
You should be prepared to defend them with your life.
You should become a Purge Trooper with that confidence. I know I'd feel safer.
You should feel lucky just to be aboard. This is a galaxy-class luxury starliner!
You should focus on your mission, Cal.
You should get that checked out.
You should get what you came for.
You should have seen those Wookiees burn.
You should have told me.
You should run from this squadron.
You should shoot!
You should stop wasting your time at the bar and spend your credits somewhere else. 
You shouldn't have crossed us. 
You shouldn't have done that!
You snake! Stop lurking down there. 
You speak of the venom.
You stand and blast. You shouldn't be running away. Get back to position. 
You still are. We're on this quest, aren't we? 
You still back there?
You still givin' Cere the cold shoulder?
You still have a choice.
You stole from the Temple?
You stopped me?
You studying the Nightsisters?
You sure he's up there?
You sure it's not your food?
You sure know how to have fun.
You sure the comm's fixed? They're not answering.
You sure these vines are safe? They're getting pretty big.
You sure this is our bounty?
You sure you want to plug into this thing?
You sure you're a Jedi?
You sure you're ready kid? No coming back from this one.
You survived, Cal.
You survived.
You talk almost as much as our small captain. 
You taught me that, Cere.
You taught yourself?
You there! 
You there! Approach slowly!
You there! Come here!
You there! Get over here!
You there! Identify yourself!
You there! Present yourself!
You there. Come here. 
You think Greez is putting bets on if we succeed or not?
You think I'm gonna let you walk away with the holocron?
You think Saw and the others will be okay?
You think he was anymore clear then than he is on those logs he left behind?
You think it'll work?
You think it's bogling bait?
You think that lightsaber proves you a Jedi?
You think that was hard? Just wait.
You think that's funny?
You think this'll get ugly, BD?
You think you can run?
You think you're tough?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
You too! Don't get yourself killed.
You too.
You touch an object and witness events connected to it.
You trained for that?
You trespass, Jedi.
You truly have the wits of a scrapper.
You trust Cere?
You two still fighting or... Never mind, I'll just stay out of it.
You two?
You underestimate my power!
You wanna climb up a zipline?
You wanna meet some, uh...
You want a chance?
You want a shot at him?
You want a show?
You want to handle this?
You want to meet them?
You wanted me to do all this for bragging rights?
You warming up to me, kid?
You waste energy!
You wasted your life.
You were always going to lose. 
You were cheap, you had zero qualms about breaking the law and I had a hunch you wouldn't betray me.
You were destined to fail.
You were either with them or... well, you know. 
You were never a match for me.
You were no match.
You were spared?
You were talkin' in your sleep.
You were testing me?
You were told to deal with it.
You were weak!
You were wrong to return here unarmed.
You will always be weak.
You will be crushed.
You will be tested.
You will bleed!
You will die!
You will die, Jedi!
You will die.
You will die. 
You will drop me. Now. 
You will fall before me!
You will fall before me. 
You will fall before us. 
You will fall to me.
You will fall!
You will fall. 
You will feel cut off.
You will find the enemy down below. 
You will go no further.
You will halt!
You will kill no more of my Brothers!
You will kneel before me!
You will kneel in death.
You will master any path.
You will need this.
You will never escape.
You will never overpower me!
You will not beat me.
You will not block me now. 
You will not break me. 
You will not catch me. 
You will not defeat me!
You will not defeat me. 
You will not defeat the Empire!
You will not defeat us!
You will not deny me. 
You will not escape again. 
You will not escape me. 
You will not escape this. 
You will not escape!
You will not escape. 
You will not fell me!
You will not kill me!
You will not refuse me!
You will not survive. 
You will not take this power from me!
You will not win, Jedi. 
You will not win. 
You will pay for their deaths.
You will pay for this. 
You will pay!
You will perish!
You will perish, traitor!
You will regret doing that. 
You will regret that.
You will?
You won't avoid all attacks.
You won't be going alone.
You won't be seein' me for a while, Prauf.
You won't be standing much longer. 
You won't beat me.
You won't block this.
You won't break me.
You won't break through.
You won't catch everything.
You won't catch me.
You won't catch me. 
You won't defeat the Empire.
You won't defeat us. 
You won't dodge this.
You won't drop me. 
You won't escape again!
You won't escape me!
You won't escape me, Jedi. 
You won't escape me.
You won't escape me. 
You won't escape so easily.
You won't escape the Brood.
You won't escape this!
You won't escape!
You won't escape.
You won't escape. 
You won't find it on any maps.
You won't fool me with that.
You won't get away again. 
You won't get away from me!
You won't get away that easy.
You won't get away up there.
You won't get away!
You won't get away.
You won't get away. 
You won't get far!
You won't get far, Jedi.
You won't get far.
You won't get me like that.
You won't get me!
You won't get me.
You won't get me. 
You won't get through. 
You won't hit me.
You won't kill me!
You won't kill me.
You won't land another.
You won't last long.
You won't live forever. 
You won't prevail!
You won't repel this.
You won't retreat!
You won't slip away!
You won't slip away. 
You won't stop me!
You won't stop me.
You won't stop me. 
You won't stop us!
You won't strike me down.
You won't strike me. 
You won't survive much longer. 
You won't survive the day.
You won't survive.
You won't win, Jedi!
You worry about the mission, I'll worry about keeping us off their radar.
You worry over your plants?
You worry too much.
You would be wise to surrender.
You would have made an excellent Inquisitor.
You wouldn't beat us!
You wouldn't know what to do with him if you found him.
You! Approach slowly!
You! Come here!
You! End him!
You! Get back!
You! Get up here. 
You! How?
You! Identify yourself!
You! Interloper! Come here!
You! Intruder! Halt!
You! Present yourself to us!
You! Stop right there!
You! Stop!
You! You there! Come here!
You'd have no chance.
You'd never make it as an Inquisitor.
You'd perish if you stayed.
You'll be back.
You'll be back. 
You'll be fine, Cal.
You'll be smashed.
You'll be sorry!
You'll be sorry.
You'll be with your master soon.
You'll die a failure!
You'll die by my hand.
You'll die just like your master. 
You'll die like the rat you are.
You'll die like the rest of your pathetic kind.
You'll die like the rest!
You'll fall like the rest!
You'll find no escape up there...
You'll find out soon enough.
You'll have a friend with you.
You'll have to be quicker than that!
You'll have to come down!
You'll have to do better. 
You'll have to pick up the slack!
You'll have to try harder!
You'll have to try harder. 
You'll let your guard down soon. 
You'll need to try harder. 
You'll never escape from me.
You'll never escape me. 
You'll never make it out of this place alive.
You'll never stop the Brood. 
You'll never train someone your way. Both people have to be willing to learn.
You'll pay dearly for that.
You'll pay for that!
You'll pay for that. 
You'll pay for that. Dearly. 
You'll pay for that...
You'll pay for their deaths. 
You'll pay when I find you. 
You'll pay when I'm free. 
You'll pay!
You'll pay! 
You'll pay, outsider!
You'll regret running from us, Jedi.
You'll regret that!
You'll regret that.
You'll regret that. 
You'll regret this. 
You'll regret your deeds!
You'll rot in the swamps!
You'll run out of stims soon. 
You'll slip eventually.
You'll slip up.
You'll soon slip up. 
You're Trilla.
You're a big help, BD-1.
You're a big help, you know that?
You're a coward!
You're a dangerous one. 
You're a life saver, you know that?
You're a monster.
You're a quick one!
You're a quick one. 
You're agreeing with me?
You're all mine now.
You're almost done.
You're almost finished. 
You're almost there.
You're always seeing the bright side.
You're as good as dead.
You're bleeding...
You're boring me.
You're capable of more, why hold back?
You're clear, go!
You're dead when I'm free!
You're dead!
You're dead. 
You're disgusting. 
You're doing admirable work, BD-1. I'm glad you're with us. Keep close to Cal.
You're doing good work, Cal. Thank you.
You're done hurting this world.
You're done. 
You're easily countered!
You're exposed!
You're exposed.
You're fading. 
You're falling behind!
You're falling behind.
You're famous down there.
You're fast. 
You're fast...
You're frightened.
You're full of surprises!
You're full of surprises.
You're fun!
You're gambling again, aren't you?
You're getting lucky.
You're giving us a lift?
You're goin' down!
You're going down!
You're going down, Jedi.
You're going down, Jedi. 
You're going down.
You're going down. 
You're going down. Jedi. 
You're going to bleed.
You're going to die now.
You're going to pay. 
You're going to regret that!
You're going to regret that. 
You're going to start with this.
You're gonna be sorry. 
You're gonna die here.
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die... Jedi. 
You're gonna have to find another way.
You're gonna mess up.
You're gonna regret being here. 
You're gonna regret runnin'!
You're gonna regret this. 
You're gonna slip up.
You're gonna slip. 
You're hurtin' now!
You're in a rush.
You're in for it now!
You're in for it!
You're in the right place.
You're in trouble now. 
You're in trouble!
You're in violation of Imperial Protocol Z-207. Stand down or we won't he-
You're just afraid. 
You're just delaying the inevitable. 
You're just dragging it out. 
You're just dragging this out.
You're just prolonging this.
You're just scared. 
You're just stalling. 
You're kidding, right?
You're lacking.
You're learning.
You're letting him escape!
You're lighting up Imperial channels. They're sending everything they've got at you.
You're like their parent.
You're lookin' at another 3 hours.
You're looking hurt!
You're looking shaky. 
You're making a mistake!
You're making good progress, Cal.
You're making it look easy.
You're messing with the odds.
You're mine Jedi!
You're mine to kill, Jedi.
You're mine!
You're mine, Jedi!
You're mine, Jedi.
You're mine, traitor!
You're mine, traitor.
You're mine, traitor. 
You're mine. 
You're next, Jedi.
You're no joke, huh?
You're no match for me.
You're no match for the Brood!
You're no match for us!
You're no match!
You're no match.
You're not alone.
You're not dead yet.
You're not entirely useless. 
You're not escaping again.
You're not getting away!
You're not getting me!
You're not getting me, Jedi.
You're not getting out of here alive!
You're not getting out of here alive, Jedi!
You're not getting out of this.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not leaving here.
You're not scary.
You're not so skilled. 
You're not so tough.
You're not stealthy.
You're not that elusive, Jedi.
You're not the best gambler, Greez.
You're not very good at that.
You're not winning this.
You're not worth my time.
You're not worth my time. 
You're not worth our time.
You're not wrong.
You're nothing compared to me, Jedi.
You're nothing.
You're one to talk.
You're only a task to me.
You're only making this worse.
You're only making this worse. 
You're outclassed.
You're outmatched. 
You're payin' for that. 
You're pretty fast!
You're pretty quick.
You're quick!
You're quick, Jedi.
You're quick, aren't you!
You're quick.
You're quick. 
You're quick. Good for you. 
You're quick. I'll give you that. 
You're quick. I'll still get you. 
You're quite agile. 
You're really something. 
You're right on that one, kid. Oh, hey, if it turns up let me know. Or I could just make another one, I guess. Uh, that'll be fun.
You're right, I know. Just wanna blow off some stress every once in awhile, y'know?
You're right, there's no time.
You're right.
You're right. That other ice wall is in the way.
You're right. We can't afford to fail.
You're right. We need another power source.
You're right. we can't search the whole forest. Better get back to Saw.
You're right. we can't search the whole forest. Mari and Choy have the best shot at finding him.
You're right. we can't search the whole forest. Mari and Choyyssyk have the best shot at finding him.
You're running out of time.
You're shaking.
You're slippery. 
You're slipping.
You're slipping. 
You're slow.
You're still a weakling.
You're still going down.
You're still on board. 
You're still struggling with the dark side.
You're stronger than this! Fight!
You're swift, aren't you?
You're swift.
You're swift...
You're tellin' me. You lose someone?
You're the best.
You're the best. 
You're the one the Nightbrothers follow.
You're thinking of leaving?
You're too close!
You're too quick!
You're too scared. Just blast when you see him.
You're too slow for me.
You're too slow.
You're under arrest!
You're unstoppable. 
You're vulnerable out there. Don't take any unnecessary risks.
You're wasting your strength.
You're weak, traitor. 
You're welcome, Cal.
You're welcome, Cal. Let's keep going. 
You're welcome. We're all in this together.
You're worried about me. 
You're wrecking the odds!
You're wretched.
You're... friends?!
You're.... you're a coward!
You've become weak.
You've been fighting for so long. Have you learned anything from war?
You've been inside?
You've been keeping count.
You've been surviving on your own for so long that it's impossible to trust anyone.
You've been through a lot to get here, but the Vault is still an unknown.
You've been training. Good.
You've come a long way since Bracca, but the path is far from over. I want you to know the difficult challenges ahead.
You've done Dathomir a favor by ridding us of that foul creature. 
You've done it!
You've done more than your share. Thank you, Cal.
You've done very well, Cal, I've seen that, but there are many more challenges ahead. If the Empire gets to the Tomb...
You've experienced great suffering.

You've made your last mistake. 
You've received training.
You've thwarted my attack.
You've told me everything I need to know. Right now, the only thing I can do is finish what we started.
You've told me what the Empire will do with this astrium. What will you do with it?
You, my friend, are unstoppable.
You, uh, know any jokes, BD?
You. Are. Mine.
You.. you shouldn't be here!
You...
You... won't escape me!
You... you killed them all.

Your new master harbors great darkness.
Your next move is to pay attention. That's your only move right now.

"BD-1, This may be the last you see of me. I can sense the doom of the Jedi Order is upon us. I must leave the holocron behind - if anything happens to me, I trust that another will come to find it. You agreed to guard this secret, at the cost of your own memories. I will never forget that sacrifice. I believe in you, as I always have. If another Jedi comes to Bogano, you will be their guide. Thank you. Goodbye, my friend."

"In accordance with the Emperor's will we've occupied Zeffo, "redistributing" its inhabitants. This planet has failed to yield significant data or relics for Project Auger. <cf>Its electromagnetic winds have rendered the bulk of our mining technology useless. Meanwhile, more troopers lose their lives to dangerous fauna. <cf>We will not be able to fulfill our directive here. It is my recommendation that we disband the project and leave a token outpost to keep scavengers from stealing our technology."
"My Friend, After my analysis of the architecture in Eilram's Tomb, I confirmed the Zeffo had contact with Kashyyyk! It's time to call on an old friend. There's a good chance Chieftain Tarfful can provide the information I seek."
"My Friend, Entering the Vault gave me a premonition just as it did for the Zeffo. I saw the fall of the Jedi, the overwhelming power of the dark side spreading across the galaxy! We must act quickly. I need to inform the Council!"
"My Friend, I believe this to be the earliest Zeffo site we've uncovered yet. Despite my reservations, I cannot chase the Bogano Vault from my mind. Its visions shaped the direction of an entire culture. I must understand why."
"My Friend, I finally found an intact representation of the most sacred Zeffo artifact. A depiction of Miktrull at the Vault on Bogano - you can see the object in their hand. I believe it allows a Force wielder to perceive the mysteries of the Vault. It is the key and the guide: the Zeffo Astrium! But who destroyed images of it and why? It requires further research, however the next step is clear: find an Astrium, if any still exist." 
"My Friend, I flew with all haste to Coruscant and presented my findings to the Council. Despite my persistence, despite my research, they do not take this threat seriously. Only one person believed in me. My old confidant, Jocasta Nu. She entrusted me with a holocron from the Jedi Archives - a secret copy of her list of young Force-sensitives."
"My Friend, I found my quarry atop Kashyyyk's Origin Tree: the Astrium. This relic is the key to the vault on Bogano. The dark side clouded every attempt at finding one on Dathomir, but the Force provided a new path!"
"My Friend, I recently discovered the Zeffo had some interest in Dathomir. Strange for such a culture to have any sort of fascination with a place so... dark. There's more to be discovered on Dathomir."
"My Friend, I've unearthed a curious artifact. An ancient sphere capable of storing and conducting massive amounts of energy. Whatever civilization crafted this must be the same that created the seemingly impenetrable structure nearby! I believe studying this sphere may yield the information I need to discover who they were and why they built such a landmark."
"My Friend, My name is Jedi Master Eno Cordova. The Bogano Vault - constructed by the Zeffo millennia ago - granted me a vision of the Jedi's doom. To preserve the Order, I've hidden a holocron detailing the names and locations of all known young Force-sensitives deep within the Vault. To access the holocron you must seek out the tombs of three great Zeffo Sages. BD-1 will aid you on your journey. He will be your guide."
"My Friend, Never have I seen a view more exquisite than atop this tree. The climb has given me time to reflect. It was the will of the Force that I found Bogano, and that I am here now. There is a greater journey ahead."
"My Friend, This tomb is utterly fascinating. It once served as a proving ground for Force-sensitive Zeffo sages, but was converted into a space to honor their remains. And yet nothing received greater honor here than the Force itself, the Life Wind, as they called it. It's beautiful to see."
"My Friend, as Tarfful led us here he spoke of a glorious creature called the Shyyyo Bird. He said the bird is the forest's protector. So rare it's nearly legendary. I would dearly love to research this creature further, but the Astrium must be my priority. I hope to one day return and search for the Shyyyo with Tarfful."
"My Friend, examinations of the sphere proved fruitful. I've found similar relics across Bogano's surface, including a precious few with glyphs! After much study, I've discerned a pattern and begun to translate their language. Within their glyphs, I've determined the words Sage, Vault, and Tomb. There is more: what appears to be coordinates to the Zeffo system! Perhaps this is the same ancient civilization which abounded there!"
"My Friend, these devices appear to simulate this planet's gravitational pull. I can't help but see it as a motif. This place, less a tomb and more a temple to one ruler's pride. I've found repeated glyphs with the same word: "Astrium." Always near damaged statues. I believe this Astrium was once a ubiquitous, sacred symbol. Perhaps even linked to the Vault."
"My Friend, we've reached the tomb of Kujet in search of an Astrium. It is more secluded than even I would've thought. It seems the way in was secret even during the time of the Zeffo. A contrast from the ostentatious Tomb of Miktrull... yet not a welcome one. The Nightsisters of Dathomir granted me passage, but even they warned me against these ruins. Something dark transpired here - I can feel it."
"My Friend, what I've found here is disconcerting. It seems these candles were offerings brought to this tomb in exaltation of the Sage Miktrull. At first I believed them votives to the Life Wind, but the further I delve into this tomb the less the evidence supports this. And yet there is one gift that intrigues me, statuary of Zeffo holding circular objects much like spheres. Though much of this tomb is well preserved, these are uniformly destroyed. An interesting puzzle."
"My friend, I have never been one to shy away from the pursuit of knowledge, but the shadow of the dark side lies heavy in this tomb. I've uncovered Kujet's legacy: a ruthless leader who destroyed the Astriums and lives of any who opposed the sage's rule. These Zeffo were once Kujet's enemies, brave rebels who stood against tyranny. F-forgive me. I've spent too many rotations on this planet. My mind is beginning to slip. I can go no further. I must return to Zeffo."
"My friend, in the rotations since I left Bogano I've uncovered more about the Zeffo than I once believed possible. This planet, their homeworld, has been a revelation! It appears many, yet not all the Zeffo could wield the Force! They called it the "Life Wind" and those who wielded it, sages. Three names appear with frequency: Eilram, Miktrull, Kujet. It seems these sages held esteemed positions within their culture. I've informed the Council, to lukewarm reception. They have become too focused on Jedi history, but the history of the Force belongs to us all."

Luckily Choyyssyk, one of the Wookiees Cal helped liberate, had fought alongside Tarfful in the past. He and Mari Kosan, a member of Saw's guerilla fighters, agreed to find Tarfful for Cal. However, just as he received this news, Cere discovered an Imperial transmission revealing the Empire was close to unearthing another tomb on Zeffo...

An ancient automaton constructed by the Zeffo, it is believed the Tomb Guardian's central function was to protect sacred sites. As details of their abilities remain mysterious, if encountered, one should proceed with extreme caution. Cold and indifferent, they attack not out of malice or defense, but from a programmed response to intruders. Known for powerful, unblockable strikes, they can prove especially threatening in limited areas without space to dodge their attack. Their primary vulnerability appears to be the Power Core located above their central abdomen. Any disruption of the core should provoke a shut down.
An ancient burial site, hastily fashioned for an unknown race, not human.
An area sacred to the Wookiees. A sanctuary. One of the last safe zones from the Empire. Until now.

Analysis of these pipes indicates that pressure buildup from an open airlock caused them to rupture. This breach could only have occurred if the shield system was compromised, rendering it unable to protect the Fortress from hydrostatic pressure. Data suggests the Fortress may be vulnerable to flooding if airlocks are opened while its shield system is disabled.

Bogling Tunnel
Bogling tunnels connect their nests and serve as a natural defense against predators. Able to dig five meters per day, boglings collaborate in "heckles", or large packs, spending approximately one-third of their life span digging the intricate tunnel network.
Boglings
Boglings are small creatures endemic to Bogano. Natural escape artists, they evolved to run on their toes. This technique allows them to quickly change direction or jump while navigating Bogano's mix of rocky and marsh-like terrain. Their furry bodies compensate for the heat lost through their bare feet.

Bracca Scrapper
Bracca is a poor Mid Rim world dominated by rocky plains. It was the site of a fierce campaign during the Clone Wars. Battles in orbit and on the surface raged as the Separatists attempted to wrest away Republic control of the system. The Separatists were aided by sympathizers from within the Scrapper Guild, nearly leading to their victory over the planet. In retaliation, the newly formed Empire cut wages and lowered safety standards within Bracca's scrapyards.
Bracca is home to the Ibdis Maw, a superorganism that superficially resembles Tatooine's sarlaccs. The various 'mouths' of the Ibdis Maw connect to a vast, distributed digestive system that resides hundreds of meters below Bracca's surface. The mouths of the Maw that reside in the scrapyard have swollen to immense size, fed by a steady diet of starship material.
Bracca's cargo trains serve as a high-speed transport network for parts being shipped off world. The average shipment travels through 25 security checkpoints before being exported to the Core Worlds for resale.

Brula Fruit
Brula fruit was a common reagent in Nightsister potions. In small doses, its nectar could act as an antivenom to the bites of Dathomir's many poisonous snakes. Overconsumption, however, resulted in symptoms of "swamp madness" - convulsions, blurred vision, and hallucinations. 
Built by Jedi - The making of Jedi: Fallen Order
Built by the Jedi Masters who constructed the temple on Ilum a thousand years ago, this window magnified natural outside light for heat. A beam of intense light generated through the large glass portal was then directed to specific areas of ice that melted under the heat.
Burial Pods
Burial place
Burial pods were an essential part of Nightsister funerary rites. Readying each component of a pod was a painstaking practice. The cloth wraps were washed three times in magickal waters, the twine hand-braided while reciting a spell of protection, and the bodies cleansed with fragrant oils.
Burly and heavily built, its forceful attacks will affect even the toughest defenses.

By combining Cere and Jaro's hilts, Cal created a lightsaber that can be split in two.
Cal
Cal Kestis
Cal Kestis is a young scrapper working on the remote world of Bracca, but hiding a dangerous secret: he was a Jedi Padawan. When his close friend, Prauf is about to be killed in a tragic accident, Cal uses the Force to save him. The event reveals Cal as a Jedi to the deadly killers of the Empire, the Inquisitors, and he barely escapes aboard a rogue starship thanks to two new friends.
Cal Kestis, a former Jedi Padawan, has been hiding out on Bracca since Order 66. Cal joined a scrapping crew and lived in hiding for years, but blew his cover when he used the Force to save his friend Prauf from a deadly fall. This prompted the ruthless Second and Ninth Sisters to attack him. Cal was narrowly saved by two mysterious individuals: Cere Junda and Greez Dritus. Now, they find themselves on the remote planet Bogano, ready to discover the secrets of an ancient Vault...
Cal and BD brought the Astrium to the Vault and found the holocron. Cal was swept into a vision. Younglings training, only to be ambushed by the Empire! A battle, death, torture, Cal as an Inquisitor. When he awoke, Trilla stood before him. Cal pulled her lightsaber, thrusting him into a Force echo: Cere and Trilla tortured, Trilla's turn, Cere's escape. When he returned, Trilla and the holocron were gone. Cal ran back to the ship and told Cere. She reached out to the Force, took up Trilla's lightsaber and knighted Cal...
Cal and BD found their way to the ruins, where Cal faced a dark version of Jaro Tapal. This phantom shattered Cal's lightsaber, leaving him defenseless. Cal and BD fled the ruin, running into the Wanderer. He revealed himself as Taron Malicos, a former Jedi now studying the dark side. Malicos asked Cal to join his quest for power, but was cut off by Merrin. She raised a horde of undead to destroy him and Cal. Cal and BD rushed back to the Mantis. After Cal's confession about Order 66, Cere says it's time for him to build his own lightsaber... 
Cal and BD nearly made it to the next tomb when they were ambushed by Nightbrothers. While the two were safe, they were forced to wander through the dangerous Dathomirian swamps. They were once again found by the Nightsister Merrin who began raising undead Nightsisters to attack them as they traveled. Inside a dark cave, BD found Climbing Claws on a Nightbrother corpse - just as the dreaded Gorgara came home to roost. During the fight, Gorgara snatched them into an aerial battle, culminating in a crash that killed the bat-like beast.

Cal carries trauma from the horrifying experience of Order 66 when he and his Master, Jaro Tapal, were attacked by their own troops. With Tapal's help, Cal escaped, but his Master was killed. In his dying moment, Tapal gave Cal his lightsaber and these words of advice: "Trust only in the Force."
Cal dashes forward and attacks his target.  Jump while dashing to flip over the target instead.
Cal encounters BD-1 while exploring the mysterious world Bogano. BD-1 is curious, good-natured and utterly fearless in the face of danger. He has quickly grown attached to Cal and seems intent on leading the young Jedi towards something or someone waiting inside the ancient Vault that looms over Bogano's horizon.
Cal has healed his connection with the Force
Cal helps Cere come to terms with her violent past and let go. Armed with Trilla's lightsaber, she uses it to knight Cal. Together as Jedi, they venture to the evil depths of the Fortress Inquisitorius to retrieve the holocron and complete their quest.
Cal learns Cere lied, hiding that her former Padawan Trilla is the Second Sister. When Cere was tortured by the Empire, she was forced to betray Trilla. The Empire then captured Trilla and turned her into an Inquisitor. Cere, devastated, used the dark side of the Force in order to escape. Fearful she will slip back to the dark, Cere vowed to never use the Force again.

Cal remembers this ability after a potentially deadly fall at the Origin Tree.
Cal returned to face the shade of Jaro Tapal. He realized the only way to defeat Jaro was to embrace his past and move forward. He knelt before Jaro's spectre, causing the apparition to vanish. As Cal and BD moved into the Tomb of Kujet, they came upon Merrin. This time, however, she was willing to talk. Cal learned that she might be the only survivor of the Nightsister massacre carried out by General Grievous during the Clone Wars. Merrin learned about the Jedi purge and Cal disavowed Malicos as a fallen Jedi.

Cal, BD, and Cere infiltrated the Fortress Inquisitorius as Merrin cloaked the Mantis. Trilla waited for them inside, where she and Cal had a climactic battle and Cal took back the holocron. Cere stepped in and apologized for the pain she caused Trilla. Just as it seemed the plea might reach her, Darth Vader appeared and murdered Trilla. Cere and Cal ran for their lives. Vader nearly trapped them, but Cere used the Force to protect Cal. A favor he returned once the Fortress flooded. Merrin and Greez rescued them and the holocron.

Cere Junda
Cere Junda is a former Jedi who survived Order 66. After years in seclusion, she teamed up with starship captain Greez Dritus on a secret mission to rebuild the Jedi Order. After saving Cal from the Imperial Inquisitorius, she begins to mentor him.
Cere gifted Cal her lightsaber hilt, though her kyber crystal had been sold long ago to pay for Greez's debts. Inside the caves, Cal followed the call of his crystal through a crack in an ice wall. The ice beneath Cal and BD shattered, sending Cal plummeting into icy water. BD saved Cal just in time, but the crystal split in two. That triggered a log from Cordova, revealing BD sacrificed his memories to store logs vital to Cal's quest. Cal combined Cere's and Jaro's hilts, creating a lightsaber with single, double, and dual-wield capabilities.
Cere reveals her mentor was a Jedi named Eno Cordova, a loner who studied lost cultures and often challenged the wisdom of the Jedi Council. While the two remained in contact throughout her years as a Jedi Knight, they were never very close. 
Cere shares an awful memory about her past. During the Jedi Purge, she was captured and tortured by the Empire. She was able to escape, but her Padawan was not so lucky. Years later, the event has left her scarred and reluctant to use the Force.

When practical, EA will notify you of the action it will take in response to violations of these rules or breach of this Agreement.<cf><cf>Specific EA Services may post additional rules that apply to your conduct on those services.<cf><cf>If you encounter another user who is violating any of these rules, please report this activity to EA using the "Help" or "Report Abuse" functions in the relevant EA Service, if available, or contact Customer Support at help.ea.com.<cf><cf>EA may, in its discretion, monitor or record online activity or Content on EA Services and may remove any Content from any EA Service at its discretion. Remember that your communications and your UGC in an EA Service are public and will be seen by others.<cf><cf>Your use of EA Services is subject to EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. <cf><cf>7. PC Products<cf><cf>This Section applies to EA Services for play on a Personal Computer ("EA PC Products"). To access and use EA Services associated with an EA PC Product, you may first need to register with the serial code enclosed with the EA PC Product.<cf><cf>A. Technical and Content Protection Measures<cf><cf>EA utilizes certain technical or content protection measures to prevent piracy and the unauthorized copying or use of an EA PC Product. EA PC Products use Origin Online Activation and also may use Sony DADC Austria AG's Denuvo content protection technology. To see which games use Denuvo, visit https://www.ea.com/legal. An EA Account, including the acceptance of this Agreement and EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com, installation of the Origin client application (https://www.origin.com/en-us/about), acceptance of the Origin EULA, and an Internet connection are required to authenticate the EA PC Product and verify your license upon the initial launch of the EA PC Products on any unique machine ("Authenticate" or "Authentication"). The serial code provided with this EA PC Products will be verified during Authentication. Authentication is limited to one EA Account per serial code, which means the EA PC Product is not transferable. EA may validate your license by subsequent online Authentication. There is no limit to the total number of machines on which the EA PC Products can be Authenticated, but you may launch and access the EA PC Product on no more than five unique machines in any rolling 24-hour period. If you attempt to circumvent, disable or tamper with these technical protection measures, the EA PC Product may not function properly and this License shall terminate for your material breach. Keep your serial code because you may need it to install the EA PC Service on other machines. This technology may interfere with certain applications, such as debuggers, that can be used to circumvent access-control technology.<cf><cf>B. Monitoring<cf><cf>EA utilizes certain technologies to detect and prevent cheating in connection with the use of EA PC Products. These are described below. You can visit https://www.ea.com/legal to know which technology is used with each EA PC Product.<cf><cf>Punkbuster. EA may use Punkbuster Anti-Cheat technology from Even Balance, Inc. You may opt to install Punkbuster during the installation of an EA PC Product. If it is installed, when you connect online to a game server using Punkbuster, Punkbuster will monitor your computer's random access memory (RAM) for Unauthorized Third Party Programs running concurrently with the EA PC Product and any modifications to the EA PC Product's files enabling or facilitating cheating. An Unauthorized Third Party Program is a third party program or file (such as a "addon", "mod", "hack", "trainer", or "cheat") that EA believes (i) enables or facilitates cheating of any type: (ii) allows users to modify or hack the game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by EA: or (iii) Intercepts, "mines", or otherwise collects information from or through the game. If you uninstall the EA PC Product, Punkbuster will remain dormant on your computer. To uninstall Punkbuster, run the executable at https://www.evenbalance.com/downloads/pbsvc/pbsvc.exe.<cf><cf>EA may use its own or Third Party anti-cheat technologies.<cf><cf>EA Anti-Cheat Technologies. EA may use its own anti-cheat technologies. When you connect online to a game server, these technologies will activate and monitor your game play, the files on your computer associated with the EA PC Product or that otherwise access our servers, and your computer's memory, purely for the purposes of detecting and preventing cheating.<cf><cf>If any of these anti-cheat technologies detects cheating, we may collect relevant information necessary for our investigation and enforcement purposes, including your account name, details about an Unauthorized Third Party Program and the EA PC Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected. We also may terminate your License and your EA Account if we determine you have been cheating.<cf><cf>When you disconnect from the game server, these anti-cheat technologies will be deactivated.<cf><cf>C. Uninstalling<cf><cf>You may uninstall EA PC Products at any time within your game settings in the Origin client. Certain locally saved files may remain on your computer after uninstallation. You may manually delete these files by searching for the game title in your My Documents folder on PC or via the file finder on a Mac.<cf><cf>8. Termination and Other Sanctions<cf><cf>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or EA. EA may terminate your access and use of any EA Services or your EA Account if EA determines that you have violated this Agreement or that there has been otherwise unlawful, improper or fraudulent use of EA Services associated with your EA Account. When practical, EA will notify you of the termination. You may lose your user name and persona as a result of an EA Account termination. If you have more than one EA Account, depending on the type of violation or misuse, EA may terminate all of your EA Accounts and all related Entitlements. If your EA Account is terminated, you will not have access to your EA Account or Entitlements and may be barred from accessing or using any EA Service again. Upon termination, your license under this Agreement also shall terminate.<cf><cf>Instead of termination and prior to any termination, EA may issue you a warning, suspend or alter your access to a particular EA Service or your EA Account, remove or revoke Entitlements at an EA Account or device level, remove or delete any content which is in violation with this Agreement, or ban your device or machine from accessing specific EA Services. If EA takes any action described in this Section, you will not be entitled to a refund (subject to any statutory refund rights) and no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement.<cf><cf>EA may terminate any EA Service at any time by giving at least thirty days' notice either via email (if available), within the affected EA Service, or on the service updates page of EA's website (https://www.ea.com/service-updates). After online service termination, no software updates will be applied to our games and we can't guarantee our mobile games will continue be available for download via iCloud (or other applicable cloud services).  Any games available via iCloud after online service termination may be removed from iCloud without further notice to you.<cf><cf>If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at help.ea.com.<cf><cf>Sections 5, 8-9, 11-15 of this Agreement survive termination of this Agreement.<cf><cf>9. Use of Data<cf><cf>When you use an EA Service, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device, including information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your EA Service usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware (for example, to protect your game stats, EA may place a randomly generated identification number in the keychain storage of your device. That identifier will be removed when you reset your device). If you play an EA Service offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. EA uses this information to operate its business, improve its products and services, provide services to and communicate with you (including for marketing purposes), provide software updates, dynamically served content and software support, and trouble-shoot bugs or otherwise enhance your experience. If you participate in online services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and achievements), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.<cf><cf>Your data is collected, used, stored and transmitted by EA Inc. in the United States, in accordance with EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com.<cf><cf>10. Other Software, Utilities and Tools<cf><cf>EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your computer, entertainment system or device. These technologies may be different across platforms, and the performance of EA Services may vary depending on your computer and other equipment. You understand that certain updates to these technologies may be required in order to continue use of an EA Services. Some of these updates may contain locked features or content that require you to pay an additional fee to access them. You consent to EA automatically installing any available updates for EA Services. Failure to install available updates may render EA Services, including EA PC Products, unplayable.<cf><cf>11. Third-Parties<cf><cf>Some EA Services may give you the option of playing on servers not owned or controlled by EA. EA does not control those services and is not responsible for your use of the EA Service on or through them. These third party services may subject you to additional or different terms and restrictions.<cf><cf>EA Services may include hyperlinks to third party web sites. Those sites may collect data or solicit personal information from you. EA does not control those sites and is not responsible for their content or for their collection, use or disclosure of personal information.<cf><cf>12.

BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND EA EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<cf><cf>This Section offers a streamlined way to resolve disputes between us if they arise. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily by logging into the EA customer support interface with your Account at help.ea.com. If EA cannot resolve your concern, you and EA agree to be bound by the procedure set forth in this Section to resolve any and all disputes between us.<cf><cf>This Section is an agreement between you and EA, and applies to our respective agents, employees, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, beneficiaries and assigns. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. This Section shall be interpreted broadly and shall survive termination of this Agreement.<cf><cf>A. Claims Covered by Arbitration<cf><cf>All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any EA Service and its marketing, or the relationship between you and EA ("Disputes") shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration. This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. The only Disputes not covered by this Section are claims (i) regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, EA's or EA's licensors' trade secrets or copyright, trademark or patent rights; (ii) if you reside in Australia, to enforce a statutory consumer right under Australia consumer law; and (iii) brought in small claims court.<cf><cf>B. Informal Negotiations<cf><cf>You and EA shall first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. The informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ("Notice of Dispute"). The Notice of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing or email address. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.<cf><cf>C. Binding Arbitration<cf><cf>If you and EA cannot resolve a Dispute informally, you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, EA will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<cf><cf>D. Limitations<cf><cf>YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator shall not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If this specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.<cf><cf>E. Location<cf><cf>If you live in the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<cf><cf>F. Recovery<cf><cf>If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before EA makes its final written submissions to the arbitrator, then EA will:<cf><cf>1. Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 USD over and above your arbitration award; and<cf>2. Reimburse the arbitration fees that you paid to the AAA.<cf><cf>G. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement<cf><cf>EA will not enforce material changes to this agreement to arbitrate, unless you expressly agree to the changes.

PC Products<cf>This Section applies to EA Services for play on a Personal Computer ("EA PC Products"). To access and use EA Services associated with an EA PC Product, you may first need to register with the serial code enclosed with the EA PC Product.<cf><cf>Technical and Content Protection Measures<cf><cf>EA utilizes certain technical or content protection measures to prevent piracy and the unauthorized copying or use of an EA PC Product. EA PC Products use Origin Online Activation and also may use Sony DADC Austria AG's Denuvo content protection technology. To see which games use Denuvo, visit https://www.ea.com/legal. An EA Account, including the acceptance of this Agreement and EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com, installation of the Origin client application (https://www.origin.com/en-us/about), acceptance of the Origin EULA, and an Internet connection are required to authenticate the EA PC Product and verify your license upon the initial launch of the EA PC Products on any unique machine ("Authenticate" or "Authentication"). The serial code provided with this EA PC Products will be verified during Authentication. Authentication is limited to one EA Account per serial code, which means the EA PC Product is not transferable. EA may validate your license by subsequent online Authentication. There is no limit to the total number of machines on which the EA PC Products can be Authenticated, but you may launch and access the EA PC Product on no more than five unique machines in any rolling 24-hour period. If you attempt to circumvent, disable or tamper with these technical protection measures, the EA PC Product may not function properly and this License shall terminate for your material breach. Keep your serial code because you may need it to install the EA PC Service on other machines. This technology may interfere with certain applications, such as debuggers, that can be used to circumvent access-control technology.<cf><cf>Monitoring<cf><cf>EA utilizes certain technologies to detect and prevent cheating in connection with the use of EA PC Products. These are described below. You can visit https://www.ea.com/legal to know which technology is used with each EA PC Product.<cf><cf>Punkbuster. EA may use Punkbuster Anti-Cheat technology from Even Balance, Inc. You may opt to install Punkbuster during the installation of an EA PC Product. If it is installed, when you connect online to a game server using Punkbuster, Punkbuster will monitor your computer's random access memory (RAM) for Unauthorized Third Party Programs running concurrently with the EA PC Product and any modifications to the EA PC Product's files enabling or facilitating cheating. An Unauthorized Third Party Program is a third party program or file (such as a "addon", "mod", "hack", "trainer", or "cheat") that EA believes (i) enables or facilitates cheating of any type: (ii) allows users to modify or hack the game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by EA: or (iii) intercepts, "mines", or otherwise collects information from or through the game. If you uninstall the EA PC Product, Punkbuster will remain dormant on your computer. To uninstall Punkbuster, run the executable at https://www.evenbalance.com/downloads/pbsvc/pbsvc.exe.<cf><cf>EA may use its own or Third Party anti-cheat technologies.<cf><cf>EA Anti-Cheat Technologies. EA may use its own anti-cheat technologies. When you connect online to a game server, these technologies will activate and monitor your game play, the files on your computer associated with the EA PC Product or that otherwise access our servers, and your computer's memory, purely for the purposes of detecting and preventing cheating.<cf><cf>If any of these anti-cheat technologies detects cheating, we may collect relevant information necessary for our investigation and enforcement purposes, including your account name, details about an Unauthorized Third Party Program and the EA PC Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected. We also may terminate your License and your EA Account if we determine you have been cheating.<cf><cf>When you disconnect from the game server, these anti-cheat technologies will be deactivated.<cf><cf>Uninstalling<cf><cf>You may uninstall EA PC Products at any time within your game settings in the Origin client. Certain locally saved files may remain on your computer after uninstallation. You may manually delete these files by searching for the game title in your My Documents folder on PC or via the file finder on a Mac.<cf>8. Termination and Other Sanctions<cf>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or EA. EA may terminate your access and use of any EA Services or your EA Account if EA determines that you have violated this Agreement or that there has been otherwise unlawful, improper or fraudulent use of EA Services associated with your EA Account. When practical, EA will notify you of the termination. You may lose your user name and persona as a result of an EA Account termination. If you have more than one EA Account, depending on the type of violation or misuse, EA may terminate all of your EA Accounts and all related Entitlements. If your EA Account is terminated, you will not have access to your EA Account or Entitlements and may be barred from accessing or using any EA Service again. Upon termination, your license under this Agreement also shall terminate.<cf><cf>Instead of termination and prior to any termination, EA may issue you a warning, suspend or alter your access to a particular EA Service or your EA Account, remove or revoke Entitlements at an EA Account or device level, remove or delete any content which is in violation with this Agreement, or ban your device or machine from accessing specific EA Services. If EA takes any action described in this Section, you will not be entitled to a refund (subject to any statutory refund rights) and no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement.<cf><cf>EA may terminate any EA Service at any time by giving at least thirty days' notice either via email (if available), within the affected EA Service, or on the service updates page of EA's website (https://www.ea.com/service-updates). After online service termination, no software updates will be applied to our games and we can't guarantee our mobile games will continue be available for download via iCloud (or other applicable cloud services).  Any games available via iCloud after online service termination may be removed from iCloud without further notice to you.<cf><cf>If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at help.ea.com.<cf><cf>Sections 5, 8-9, 11-15 of this Agreement survive termination of this Agreement.<cf>9. Use of Data<cf>When you use an EA Service, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device, including information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your EA Service usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware (for example, to protect your game stats, EA may place a randomly generated identification number in the keychain storage of your device. That identifier will be removed when you reset your device). If you play an EA Service offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. EA uses this information to operate its business, improve its products and services, provide services to and communicate with you (including for marketing purposes), provide software updates, dynamically served content and software support, and trouble-shoot bugs or otherwise enhance your experience. If you participate in online services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and achievements), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.<cf><cf>Your data is collected, used, stored and transmitted by EA Inc. in the United States, in accordance with EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com.<cf>10. Other Software, Utilities and Tools<cf>EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your computer, entertainment system or device.

BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND EA EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<cf><cf>This Section offers a streamlined way to resolve disputes between us if they arise. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily by logging into the EA customer support interface with your Account at help.ea.com. If EA cannot resolve your concern, you and EA agree to be bound by the procedure set forth in this Section to resolve any and all disputes between us.<cf><cf>This Section is an agreement between you and EA, and applies to our respective agents, employees, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, beneficiaries and assigns. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. This Section shall be interpreted broadly and shall survive termination of this Agreement.<cf>Claims Covered by Arbitration<cf><cf>All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any EA Service and its marketing, or the relationship between you and EA ("Disputes") shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration. This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. The only Disputes not covered by this Section are claims (i) regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, EA's or EA's licensors' trade secrets or copyright, trademark or patent rights; (ii) if you reside in Australia, to enforce a statutory consumer right under Australia consumer law; and (iii) brought in small claims court.<cf><cf>Informal Negotiations<cf><cf>You and EA shall first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. The informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ("Notice of Dispute"). The Notice of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing or email address. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.<cf><cf>Binding Arbitration<cf><cf>If you and EA cannot resolve a Dispute informally, you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, EA will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<cf><cf>Limitations<cf><cf>YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If this specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.<cf><cf>Location<cf><cf>If you live in the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<cf><cf>Recovery<cf><cf>If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before EA makes its final written submissions to the arbitrator, then EA will:<cf><cf>Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 USD over and above your arbitration award; and<cf>Reimburse the arbitration fees that you paid to the AAA.<cf><cf>Changes to this Arbitration Agreement<cf><cf>EA will not enforce material changes to this agreement to arbitrate, unless you expressly agree to the changes.<cf>16.

Remember that your communications and your UGC in an EA Service are public and will be seen by others.<cf><cf>Your use of EA Services is subject to EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. <cf><cf>7. PC Products<cf><cf>This Section applies to EA Services for play on a Personal Computer ("EA PC Products"). To access and use EA Services associated with an EA PC Product, you may first need to register with the serial code enclosed with the EA PC Product.<cf><cf>A. Technical and Content Protection Measures<cf><cf>EA utilizes certain technical or content protection measures to prevent piracy and the unauthorized copying or use of an EA PC Product. EA PC Products use Origin Online Activation and also may use Sony DADC Austria AG's Denuvo content protection technology. To see which games use Denuvo, visit https://www.ea.com/legal. An EA Account, including the acceptance of this Agreement and EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com, installation of the Origin client application (https://www.origin.com/en-us/about), acceptance of the Origin EULA, and an Internet connection are required to authenticate the EA PC Product and verify your license upon the initial launch of the EA PC Products on any unique machine ("Authenticate" or "Authentication"). The serial code provided with this EA PC Products will be verified during Authentication. Authentication is limited to one EA Account per serial code, which means the EA PC Product is not transferable. EA may validate your license by subsequent online Authentication. There is no limit to the total number of machines on which the EA PC Products can be Authenticated, but you may launch and access the EA PC Product on no more than five unique machines in any rolling 24-hour period. If you attempt to circumvent, disable or tamper with these technical protection measures, the EA PC Product may not function properly and this License shall terminate for your material breach. Keep your serial code because you may need it to install the EA PC Service on other machines. This technology may interfere with certain applications, such as debuggers, that can be used to circumvent access-control technology.<cf><cf>B. Monitoring<cf><cf>EA utilizes certain technologies to detect and prevent cheating in connection with the use of EA PC Products. These are described below. You can visit https://www.ea.com/legal to know which technology is used with each EA PC Product.<cf><cf>Punkbuster. EA may use Punkbuster Anti-Cheat technology from Even Balance, Inc. You may opt to install Punkbuster during the installation of an EA PC Product. If it is installed, when you connect online to a game server using Punkbuster, Punkbuster will monitor your computer's random access memory (RAM) for Unauthorized Third Party Programs running concurrently with the EA PC Product and any modifications to the EA PC Product's files enabling or facilitating cheating. An Unauthorized Third Party Program is a third party program or file (such as a "addon", "mod", "hack", "trainer", or "cheat") that EA believes (i) enables or facilitates cheating of any type: (ii) allows users to modify or hack the game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by EA: or (iii) Intercepts, "mines", or otherwise collects information from or through the game. If you uninstall the EA PC Product, Punkbuster will remain dormant on your computer. To uninstall Punkbuster, run the executable at https://www.evenbalance.com/downloads/pbsvc/pbsvc.exe.<cf><cf>EA may use its own or Third Party anti-cheat technologies.<cf><cf>EA Anti-Cheat Technologies. EA may use its own anti-cheat technologies. When you connect online to a game server, these technologies will activate and monitor your game play, the files on your computer associated with the EA PC Product or that otherwise access our servers, and your computer's memory, purely for the purposes of detecting and preventing cheating.<cf><cf>If any of these anti-cheat technologies detects cheating, we may collect relevant information necessary for our investigation and enforcement purposes, including your account name, details about an Unauthorized Third Party Program and the EA PC Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected. We also may terminate your License and your EA Account if we determine you have been cheating.<cf><cf>When you disconnect from the game server, these anti-cheat technologies will be deactivated.<cf><cf>C. Uninstalling<cf><cf>You may uninstall EA PC Products at any time within your game settings in the Origin client. Certain locally saved files may remain on your computer after uninstallation. You may manually delete these files by searching for the game title in your My Documents folder on PC or via the file finder on a Mac.<cf><cf>8. Termination and Other Sanctions<cf><cf>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or EA. EA may terminate your access and use of any EA Services or your EA Account if EA determines that you have violated this Agreement or that there has been otherwise unlawful, improper or fraudulent use of EA Services associated with your EA Account. When practical, EA will notify you of the termination. You may lose your user name and persona as a result of an EA Account termination. If you have more than one EA Account, depending on the type of violation or misuse, EA may terminate all of your EA Accounts and all related Entitlements. If your EA Account is terminated, you will not have access to your EA Account or Entitlements and may be barred from accessing or using any EA Service again. Upon termination, your license under this Agreement also shall terminate.<cf><cf>Instead of termination and prior to any termination, EA may issue you a warning, suspend or alter your access to a particular EA Service or your EA Account, remove or revoke Entitlements at an EA Account or device level, remove or delete any content which is in violation with this Agreement, or ban your device or machine from accessing specific EA Services. If EA takes any action described in this Section, you will not be entitled to a refund (subject to any statutory refund rights) and no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement.<cf><cf>EA may terminate any EA Service at any time by giving at least thirty days' notice either via email (if available), within the affected EA Service, or on the service updates page of EA's website (https://www.ea.com/service-updates). After online service termination, no software updates will be applied to our games and we can't guarantee our mobile games will continue be available for download via iCloud (or other applicable cloud services).  Any games available via iCloud after online service termination may be removed from iCloud without further notice to you.<cf><cf>If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at help.ea.com.<cf><cf>Sections 5, 8-9, 11-15 of this Agreement survive termination of this Agreement.<cf><cf>9. Use of Data<cf><cf>When you use an EA Service, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device, including information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your EA Service usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware (for example, to protect your game stats, EA may place a randomly generated identification number in the keychain storage of your device. That identifier will be removed when you reset your device). If you play an EA Service offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. EA uses this information to operate its business, improve its products and services, provide services to and communicate with you (including for marketing purposes), provide software updates, dynamically served content and software support, and trouble-shoot bugs or otherwise enhance your experience. If you participate in online services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.<cf><cf>Your data is collected, used, stored and transmitted by EA Inc. in the United States, in accordance with EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com.<cf><cf>10. Other Software, Utilities and Tools<cf><cf>EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your computer, entertainment system or device. These technologies may be different across platforms, and the performance of EA Services may vary depending on your computer and other equipment. You understand that certain updates to these technologies may be required in order to continue use of an EA Services. Some of these updates may contain locked features or content that require you to pay an additional fee to access them. You consent to EA automatically installing any available updates for EA Services. Failure to install available updates may render EA Services, including EA PC Products, unplayable.<cf><cf>11. Third-Parties<cf><cf>Some EA Services may give you the option of playing on servers not owned or controlled by EA. EA does not control those services and is not responsible for your use of the EA Service on or through them. These third party services may subject you to additional or different terms and restrictions.<cf><cf>EA Services may include hyperlinks to third party web sites. Those sites may collect data or solicit personal information from you. EA does not control those sites and is not responsible for their content or for their collection, use or disclosure of personal information.<cf><cf>12.

BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND EA EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<cf><cf>This Section offers a streamlined way to resolve disputes between us if they arise. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily by logging into the EA customer support interface with your Account at help.ea.com. If EA cannot resolve your concern, you and EA agree to be bound by the procedure set forth in this Section to resolve any and all disputes between us.<cf><cf>This Section is an agreement between you and EA, and applies to our respective agents, employees, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, beneficiaries and assigns. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. This Section shall be interpreted broadly and shall survive termination of this Agreement.<cf><cf>A. Claims Covered by Arbitration<cf><cf>All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any EA Service and its marketing, or the relationship between you and EA ("Disputes") shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration. This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. The only Disputes not covered by this Section are claims (i) regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, EA's or EA's licensors' trade secrets or copyright, trademark or patent rights; (ii) if you reside in Australia, to enforce a statutory consumer right under Australia consumer law; and (iii) brought in small claims court.<cf><cf>B. Informal Negotiations<cf><cf>You and EA shall first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. The informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ("Notice of Dispute"). The Notice of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing or email address. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.<cf><cf>C. Binding Arbitration<cf><cf>If you and EA cannot resolve a Dispute informally, you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, EA will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<cf><cf>D. Limitations<cf><cf>YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator shall not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If this specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.<cf><cf>E. Location<cf><cf>If you live in the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<cf><cf>F. Recovery<cf><cf>If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before EA makes its final written submissions to the arbitrator, then EA will:<cf><cf>1. Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 USD over and above your arbitration award; and<cf>2. Reimburse the arbitration fees that you paid to the AAA.<cf><cf>G. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement<cf><cf>EA will not enforce material changes to this agreement to arbitrate, unless you expressly agree to the changes.<cf><cf>16.

We also may use information from third parties, for instance, to help us understand your approximate geolocation via your IP address for tax purposes, or to customize certain services to your location, and for fraud and/or abuse prevention purposes.<cf><cf>D. Legal Basis for Processing<cf><cf>If you are a resident of the European Union, we rely on a number of legal grounds to process information about you. For example, we will process information about you where we have your consent, where we have a legitimate interest to do so, where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and where we have a legal obligation to process your information. For example, we rely on our legitimate interests to serve targeted marketing and on contractual necessity to process information when you create an EA Account. To learn more about the legal grounds on which we rely to process your information for any particular purpose, please contact us via the options in Section 11 below.<cf><cf>2. How We Collect Information<cf><cf>We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you talk with our customer experience team. We and third parties also use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.<cf><cf>A. Cookies and Similar Technologies<cf><cf>Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.<cf><cf>We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our products and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our products, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement. Other examples include HTML 5 cookies, Silverlight Application Storage, device fingerprints and "flash cookies." If you want to remove flash cookies or prevent them from being placed, adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. We may adopt a DNT standard if one is established. In the meantime, you may opt out of certain types of tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing your cookie settings.<cf><cf>We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat and Anti-Fraud technologies in our products that utilize the same cookies and similar mechanisms. These technologies are described below.<cf><cf>B. Analytics Technologies<cf><cf>We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our products, your computer or device and the health of our products.<cf><cf>For instance, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our products. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in section 3, below. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display your persona and/or statistical data regarding your game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.<cf><cf>Third party analytics services integrated into our products may combine the information they collect in connection with EA's services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of third party analytics companies that operate in our products as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at privacyappendix.ea.com.<cf><cf>C. Ad Serving Technologies<cf><cf>Some of our products employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar products on EA or third party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.<cf><cf>These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:<cf><cf>- Advertisements served and the location of the ad;<cf>- Length of time an advertisement was visible;<cf>- Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and<cf>- Advertisement response.<cf><cf>Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our products with other information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at privacyappendix.ea.com.<cf><cf>To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org, www.aboutads.info/choices, youradchoices.ca, or www.youronlinechoices.eu. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.<cf><cf>D. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies<cf><cf>EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our products, set up an EA Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.

Information We Share with Third Parties<cf><cf>We do not share personal information that directly identifies you (such as your name, e-mail or postal address) with third parties for their own use without your consent, unless it is either required by law or we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights, property or operations or to protect our players or third parties. We may share anonymous or aggregated information, or other data that does not directly identify you, with third parties, for instance your persona and game stats on leaderboards or to show trends about use of our products.<cf><cf>We employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for various reasons, such as conducting market surveys, facilitating credit card processing, or sending emails. When our third party agents or service providers collect or receive personal information, we require that they use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.<cf><cf>We do not knowingly disclose directly identifying personal information from children under 18 years of age to independent third parties even with consent.<cf><cf>However, in the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law.<cf><cf>We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity. When third party technologies or social tools are integrated into our products, those third parties may collect information when you use our products. An example is the Facebook "Like" button.<cf><cf>5. Where We Hold Your Information<cf><cf>Personal information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Cookie Policy in the United States or any other country in which EA, its subsidiaries, or third party agents operate. By using our products, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.<cf><cf>EA's privacy practices comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found at https://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx.<cf><cf>Information is collected by our parent company, Electronic Arts, Inc. For information from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom and Switzerland, Electronic Arts, Inc. holds certifications under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield (which are available at www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnuQAAS&status=Active). When Electronic Arts, Inc. transfers information from the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to other affiliates, agents or service providers that are outside the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland, it will do so in compliance with the 'Accountability for Onward Transfer' principle of the Privacy Shield.<cf><cf>6. How We Protect Your Personal Information<cf><cf>Security of our players' information is a priority at EA, and we take a range of measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive financial information. Even so, no security measure is 100% perfect. This means we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use or access to your information under our control.<cf><cf>7. Children<cf><cf>Protecting children's privacy online is extremely important to EA. Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When users identify themselves as being children we will: (1) not provide a path for them to input personal information, (2) collect certain information for limited purposes only, (3) block or restrict the child from accessing relevant services, such as chat functionality; and/or (4) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, all according to applicable law. When we say children, we mean under the age of 13 or the minimum age in the relevant territory if that age is older than 13. Through our mobile applications your child will be able to receive local in-app notifications, which do not collect any personal information.<cf><cf>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA's online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages.<cf><cf>If you are a parent and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com, by writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065 or by telephone at (650) 628-1393.<cf><cf>Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this Privacy and Cookie Policy (see Section 6 above). If we make material changes to how we use, collect, or share your child's personal information, we will notify parents by email or by in-game notice in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of your child's personal information.<cf><cf>We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page at https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/OnlineSafety/US/en/PC/ for additional information about using the Internet safely.<cf><cf>Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent.<cf><cf>8. Your Choices and Controls<cf><cf>We give you meaningful choices when it comes to important uses and collection of information. For example, you can update your account information and preferences, choose to opt in or out of EA marketing emails and choose whether to share your information with select EA partners.

How We Protect Your Personal Information<cf><cf>Security of our players' information is a priority at EA, and we take a range of measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive financial information.

This means we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use or access to your information under our control.<cf><cf>7. Children<cf><cf>Protecting children's privacy online is extremely important to EA. Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When users identify themselves as being children we will: (1) not provide a path for them to input personal information, (2) collect certain information for limited purposes only, (3) block or restrict the child from accessing relevant services, such as chat functionality; and/or (4) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, all according to applicable law. When we say children, we mean under the age of 13 or the minimum age in the relevant territory if that age is older than 13. Through our mobile applications your child will be able to receive local in-app notifications, which do not collect any personal information.<cf><cf>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA's online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages.<cf><cf>If you are a parent and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com, by writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065 or by telephone at (650) 628-1393.<cf><cf>Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this Privacy and Cookie Policy (see Section 6 above). If we make material changes to how we use, collect, or share your child's personal information, we will notify parents by email or by in-game notice in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of your child's personal information.<cf><cf>We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page at https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/OnlineSafety/US/en/PC/ for additional information about using the Internet safely.<cf><cf>Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent.<cf><cf>8.

How We Collect Information<cf>We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you talk with our customer experience team via chat, email and telephone. We and third parties also use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.<cf><cf>Cookies and Similar Technologies<cf><cf>Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.<cf><cf>We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our products and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our products, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement. Other examples include HTML 5 cookies, Silverlight Application Storage, device fingerprints and "flash cookies." If you want to remove flash cookies or prevent them from being placed, adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. We may adopt a DNT standard if one is established. In the meantime, you may opt out of certain types of tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing your cookie settings.<cf><cf>We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat and Anti-Fraud technologies in our products that utilize the same cookies and similar mechanisms. These technologies are described below.<cf><cf>Analytics Technologies<cf><cf>We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our products, your computer or device and the health of our products.<cf><cf>For instance, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our products. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in section 3, below. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display your persona and/or statistical data regarding your game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.<cf><cf>Third party analytics services integrated into our products may combine the information they collect in connection with EA's services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of third party analytics companies that operate in our products as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at privacyappendix.ea.com.<cf><cf>Ad Serving Technologies<cf><cf>Some of our products employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar products on EA or third party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.<cf><cf>These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:<cf><cf>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;<cf>Length of time an advertisement was visible;<cf>Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and<cf>Advertisement response.<cf><cf>Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our products with other information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at privacyappendix.ea.com.<cf><cf>To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org, www.aboutads.info/choices, youradchoices.ca, or www.youronlinechoices.eu. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.<cf><cf>Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies<cf><cf>EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our products, set up an EA Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes. We also may use anti-cheat technology with our products, including automated anti-fraud and abuse algorithms. If you believe your access to our products and/or services was blocked by this technology in error, please contact EA Help at help.ea.com.<cf>3.

Information We Share with Third Parties<cf>We do not share personal information that directly identifies you (such as your name, e-mail or postal address) with third parties for their own use without your consent, unless it is either required by law or we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights, property or operations or to protect our players or third parties.

Feodor
Few have seen an Undead Nightsister and survived. It is believed these mummified warriors emerge from the burial pods of ancient Nightsister graveyards on foul eves or under command of a witch's incantation. They are known to be hostile to all life except their Nightsister masters. Upon sight of their prey, they release a piercing scream, calling all nearby undead. They attack in frenzied swarms, clawing and biting their way through flesh.﻿
Few survive an encounter with the most powerful Sith in the Galaxy.

Generally a hyper-aggressive, territorial species, bog rats gradually formed mutualistic relationships with splox. Splox will disturb bogling nests, luring them to the surface to be ambushed and eaten by bog rats. Once the adult boglings are out of the way, splox burrow into their nests and devour the eggs.

Imperial Scout Troopers are specially trained Stormtroopers in service to the Galactic Empire for a range of missions. They are equipped with light armor for greater mobility and specialized helmets that allow for greater adaptability. Armed with electro riot batons when blasters are identified as insufficient, they are especially skilled in melee combat, crowd control, and defense against a lightsaber.
Imperial Security Droids, also known as KX-series Security Droids, are commonly used in service to the Galactic Empire. Formidable and specialized in close combat, these droids employ a combination of brute strength and rugged durability to capture and incapacitate enemies. They are equipped with a full comm relay, scramblers, and tactical programming.
Imperial Stormtroopers are the frontline soldiers of the Galactic Empire. Conscripted from worlds across the galaxy, they have been trained to support the might of the Imperial war machine and identify threats indiscriminately. Armed with a variety of weapons, including long range blaster rifles, they are most efficient in large numbers where they may prove overwhelming.
Imperial Stormtroopers have no regard for Wookiee lives. They see this planet and its inhabitants only as a resource to exploit.
Imperial Stormtroopers were dispatched to fend off incoming attacks from local wildlife. They encountered fiercer resistance than they were prepared for.

In accordance with the Emperor's will we've occupied Zeffo, "redistributing" its inhabitants. This planet has failed to yield significant data or relics for Project Auger. <cf>Its electromagnetic winds have rendered the bulk of our mining technology useless. Meanwhile, more troopers lose their lives to dangerous fauna. <cf>We will not be able to fulfill our directive here. It is my recommendation that we disband the project and leave a token outpost to keep scavengers from stealing our technology.
In another ploy to kill Cal, Trilla lured him onto a hanging sarcophagus and instructed her forces to shoot it down. In that moment, Cal regained the ability to Pull his lightsaber and narrowly escaped. On their way out of the tomb, Cal and BD found another encrypted log from Cordova, explaining the key to the Bogano Vault is a device called the Zeffo Astrium. To access the Vault, they'll need to find one. Before he could return to the ship Cal was captured by a bounty hunter. Who they work for remains a mystery... 
In his final message, Master Cordova revealed a close connection to BD-1, his faithful companion droid. On their many adventures, they shared close trust as BD-1 recorded Cordova's journey and vital knowledge. When they parted ways, BD-1 agreed to have his memory banks encrypted with this information, beginning his important mission and saying goodbye to one another.
In the eye of an enormous storm, Cal and BD-1 found the Tomb of Eilram. Inside, Cal saw a vision of his former Master, Jaro Tapal, which helped him rediscover his ability to Push objects with the Force. As they were leaving, Cal and BD found another holo from Cordova pointing them to Kashyyyk...
In the wake of his terrifying experience on Dathomir, Cal travels to Ilum to construct a new lightsaber. With the help of his new Master, Cere Junda, he is able to conquer the horror of his past and forge his new Jedi weapon. Cal moves forward, now determined to complete his mission, let go of his tragic past, and choose his own destiny.
In their final confrontation, Malicos attempts to convince Cal to join him. Believing the Jedi era is over, the two clash in ideology. The battle escalates, finally tipped when Merrin helps Cal defeat the sinister Malicos.
In their search for Zeffo artifacts, these stormtroopers suffered an unexpected and horrific encounter with a Tomb Guardian.

Jedi Master Eno Cordova originally created this weather sensor to help him decide whether or not to wear a sweater on his excavations. To his surprise, the data he retrieved showed traces of electromagnetic radiation in Bogano's winds. Though it exists in much lower concentrations than on Zeffo, Cordova theorized this could be one reason the Zeffo chose to create their Vault on Bogano. 
Jedi Master Eno Cordova was a scholar and explorer revered for his knowledge of ancient civilizations. After experiencing a vision of the Order's doom, Cordova hid a holocron containing identities of young Force-sensitives in the Bogano Vault.
Jedi Master Jaro Tapal was a General during the Clone Wars who mentored his Padawan, Cal Kestis, with a firm and disciplined doctrine. During Order 66, Tapal was mortally wounded but managed to get Cal to safety. In Tapal's last moment, he passed his lightsaber to Cal.

Menacing Bounty Hunters of all kinds make up the Haxion Brood. Augmented with droid parts and jetpacks, they are driven by both the massive reward and the thrill of the hunt, chasing only the most dangerous prey. Cocky and self-assured, they haven't lost a bounty yet and don't intend to.
Mercenary
Merciless and bombastic Umbaran leader of the Haxion Brood. Tormo takes great pleasure in his fight club, an infamous arena where the galaxy wagers on open combat against bloodthirsty killers and Tormo's wild menagerie of vicious space beasts. Never shy on humor, he is a mercurial mobster with a penchant for violence and greed.
Merrin
Merrin allowed Cal to pass, warning that Malicos was ahead. Malicos tried one last time to turn Cal, but attacked when he refused. It appeared Malicos would win but Merrin intervened, blasting Malicos with magick. They worked together to defeat Malicos. After, Cal revealed that he came to Dathomir for an Astrium. Merrin agreed to help him, and they found one in Kujet's Tomb. Desiring more knowledge of the galaxy and a future for her people, Merrin joined Cal's quest. Together, the crew stands ready to return to Bogano and find the holocron... 
Merrin confronted both Cal and Malicos, enraged Malicos would ally himself with a Jedi after years of convincing her they were the enemy. Seeing proof of Malicos' deception, she uses magick to unleash a horde of undead Nightsisters to destroy the outsiders.
Merrin prayed to her lost sisters for forgiveness. She made a deal with Malicos and agreed to teach him their magick, but she was worried he couldn't be trusted.

Nightbrothers "paint" glyphs using acid from the hydraatis. Rather than staining the surface, the acid burns into even the hardest rockfaces, leaving permanent marks. Each symbol must be carefully drawn both to preserve accuracy and avoid damage to oneself. Master calligraphers are rare and extremely valued for their talents.
Nightbrothers are a male warrior subspecies of Zabraks based on Dathomir. For centuries, their simple society was governed by Nightsisters, witches that ruled the planet but were decimated during the Clone Wars. Territorial and extremely hostile to outsiders, fighters in their ranks are highly acrobatic, agile and proficient in a variety of mixed combat.
Nightbrothers fought in this ruined arena to demonstrate their strength. Winning meant honor, respect and power over the weak.
Nightbrothers only recently began efforts to domesticate the bane back spider. Without the Nightsisters' magickal antivenoms, the task has occasionally proven deadly. However, if a spider is captured young and raised alongside a Nightbrother, it will bond with him and become a lasting companion.
Nightbrothers were thrown into a pit, killed by beasts. No doubt to set an example.

Old Memoirs
Old friends met here - the Jedi Eno Cordova and Wookiee Chieftain Tarfful. They shared a great respect for each other.
Oleg
Ominous Effigy
On
On Bracca, an Abednedo scrap worker named Prauf befriends and mentors Cal. When an accident almost claims Prauf's life, Cal uses the Force to save him but recklessly reveals himself as a Jedi. Soon, Imperial Inquisitors arrive for Cal but Prauf gives his own life to save him, allowing Cal a chance to escape.
On Cordova's journey to Kashyyyk, he met with Chieftain Tarfful, who knew of an ancient artifact atop the Origin Tree. Cordova scaled the massive Origin Tree, where he discovered one of the last remaining Zeffo Astriums. With the Astrium he was able to access the Vault on Bogano and hide the holocron.
On the way up the Origin Tree, Cal and BD encountered the Shyyyo Bird. After saving himself from a deadly fall with Jedi Flip, Cal and BD rode the Shyyyo to the top. They discovered two things: Cordova found a Zeffo Astrium there years before, and a Zeffo tomb on Dathomir might hold another. Just as they were leaving, the Ninth Sister attacked! A fierce battle ensued, but Cal won by pushing the Ninth Sister off the tree. The grateful Shyyyo Bird gave Cal and BD a ride down. Now their hopes rest on finding an Astrium on Dathomir...
On their way out of the caves, Cal discovered a massive Imperial mining operation on Ilum - designed to extract the planet's kyber crystals. As Cal and BD fought their way back to the Mantis, Cere used Trilla's trick from Miktrull's Tomb to prevent the Empire from calling reinforcements. The Empire eventually reversed the slice, but it gave Cal and BD enough time to get back to the Mantis. Now, with his lightsaber reforged, Cal must return to Dathomir and face the dark side once again...
Once a formidable Jedi General, Malicos escaped the horrific purge of Order 66. A trained motivator and cunning tactician, he maintains a composed demeanor during combat, but will strike with ferocity and deliberate precision. Full of surprises, he utilizes his mastery of the Force with an extended assault, or as a precursor to his lightsaber attack, including a combination of dual-blades.
Once the holocron was safely on board the Mantis, Cal made the decision to destroy it. Whatever future awaits the crew, the children inside will remain safe...

One wyyyschokk can lay up to 1,000 eggs each year. With a combination of webbing, saliva and a unique secretion from lymphatic nodes under each leg, they create incredibly sturdy egg sacs that deter predators. When a young wyyyschokk is fully developed, they can spend as many as 5 days eating their way out of the shell, slowly wearing it down with their venom. They emerge ravenous, ready to attack any prey in sight.

Phillaks are masterful climbers able to move with ease on mountain paths. Solitary by nature they leave their mother's side early to find their own territory. The horns on their heads are their greatest weapon; when two phillaks clash the sound thunders across the mountains. As they age, their horns steadily grow adding a new ring for each year of their lives.

Powerful kyber crystals grow naturally on Ilum, one of the rare planets in the galaxy where they may be found. Such crystals resonate with concentrated energy in a unique manner through the Force, exhibiting a "collective consciousness," that allows them to communicate with one another and living beings. As part of Jedi training, Younglings were sent to the Crystal Caves of Ilum to mine these crystals in order to construct their own lightsabers. 
Powerful limbs cannot be severed.

Referred to in legend as the "scourge of Dathomir", the deadly Lesser Nydak is an agile and highly aggressive alpha predator. Its carnivorous appetite and relentless pursuit of prey make it a deadly foe to nearly all other life forms.

Rocket Launcher Troopers are specialized Stormtroopers serving the Galactic Empire's campaign over the galaxy. These deadly soldiers are armed with an RPS-6 smart rocket launcher, a long-range weapon that's incredibly difficult to deflect. Trained to eliminate insurgent activity, diminish uprisings, and quell dissent, they provide an effective means of ground support. Although menacing, their weapon must be reloaded after each shot, allowing targets to evade or attack.

Shyyyo Bird
Shyyyo birds are so rarely seen that they were once thought to be creatures of legend. The Shyyyo's body shape and feathers enable it to glide across long distances without expending much energy. Since the Shyyyo conserves energy so well it rarely leaves its nest - experts say a typical adult may hunt once per week. Their diet of slyyygs and wyyyschokks led to its depiction as a protector of both the Wookiees and wroshyr forests. Catching a glimpse of the Shyyyo is a rare blessing that guarantees peace for the viewer.

The ARC-170 Aggressive ReConnaissance starfighter was used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Jointly manufactured by Incom Corporation and Subpro, it would continue to see usage into the reign of the Galactic Empire, but would eventually be phased out by the newer TIE line.
The All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT), or Imperial Walker, is the backbone of the Empire's Assault Armor Division. A quadrupedal multi-troop transport deployed for heavy ground force assault, they are most often used to eliminate insurgent threats and enforce Imperial occupation throughout the galaxy. They are equipped with a host of formidable offensive capabilities, including chin-mounted long-range, heavy blaster cannons, as well as side cannons and blast-impervious armor plating.
The All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST), also known as a Scout Walker is a lightweight, bipedal two-person transport deployed for ground force support in the Galactic Empire. They were often used for swift reconnaissance and targeting smaller threats that evaded the larger AT-AT's. Equipped with chin-mounted medium blaster cannons capable of firing at a range of two klicks, as well as side cannons armed with rockets and concussion grenades targeting enemy vehicles and ground troops at close range.

The Flametrooper is a specialized commando supporting the war machine of the Galactic Empire. Highly proficient in the use of incendiary weapons, their flame rifle has a range of roughly ten meters, canvassing a wide but short range. Though limited in their agility, they make use of their weapon by restricting a target's freedom of mobility and forcing them into position. Although deadly, their flame rifle utilizes a combustible fuel source that requires time to cool down.

Maneuverable and formidable, it provided troops the ability for quick deployment and extraction in heavy combat through extensive types of terrain and climates.
The MK-270 Imperial Pulverizers are crucial for Project Auger as the icy barriers in Zeffo's cave-systems require an incredible amount of power to break through. Even the Empire's specialized saws are not sufficient to break through this ice on their own.

The Nightsister confronted the stranger and a tense negotiation took place.
The Nightsisters
The Nightsisters of Dathomir were a coven of powerful Force-sensitives. Skilled in the use of magick, an expression of the Force unknown to Jedi or Sith, they previously ruled Dathomir. Nightsister society was strictly matriarchal, with the coven answering to a Mother who also ruled the lower Nightbrother class. Their civilization was destroyed at the behest of a vengeful Count Dooku after Asajj Ventress and her sisters attempted to assassinate him.
The Nightsisters used rituals and spells to give themselves power. In the wrong hands, it could be dangerous.
The Nightsisters were led by a powerful magick-user they called "Mother".
The Ninth Sister
The Ninth Sister faces Cal in the peaks of the Origin Tree on Kashyyyk. There she reveals her gruesome history as a former Jedi tortured and mutilated into the brutal Inquisitor she has become. After an intense battle, Cal defeats her, but is she truly gone?
The Ninth Sister's block regeneration is slow. Keep the pressure to break her block.
The Oggdo is a highly threatening alpha predator at the top of the Bogano food chain. This creature attacks with an adhesive tongue capable of reaching eight meters in length that latches onto its prey, then pulls them into its jaws. This form of strike is particularly effective against most foes. Due to its thick hide, it is able to resist a straight-on lightsaber attack, and is extremely dangerous at close-range, often leaping at a target to close the distance.

The Wanderer
The Wanderer and The Witch
The Wookiees mourned the loss of someone close to them here. An elder known for their wisdom.
The Zeffo Villagers
The Zeffo's reverence of the wind shaped everything they created. The movement of wind through these chimes may once have called the sages to prayer. 
The apex predator known as Gorgara "the winged daemon of the canyon", employs trickery and versatility while soaring to dizzying heights and scouring the deepest crags. A thick, armored hide makes her resistant to straight-on attacks but certain areas may become vulnerable during combat. She is known to latch onto prey with a fierce grip, hoisting them into the air on her powerful wings.
The boldest Nightbrothers ventured into the lair of this creature as a rite of passage. Those who survived were deemed worthy.
The cavern systems under Ilum are rich in mineral substances formed during ancient geothermal evolution. The ice caves are home to several mineral classes native to the planet. 
The central interrogation chamber of the Fortress is a torture room where captured Jedi and Force-users undergo a menacing procedure to transform them into Inquisitors. Under direct orders of Emperor Palpatine, this facility was specifically designed to psychologically and physically drain a prisoner's will, forcing them to acquiesce to the evil indoctrination of the Inquisitorius. This is where Jedi die and Inquisitors are born.
The crew traveled to the Zeffo homeworld, searching for the tombs Cordova mentioned. They learned the Empire occupied Zeffo in order to mine ancient artifacts. The directive, codenamed Project Auger, was terminated after Zeffo's magnetic winds proved too difficult to deal with. Now, Cal and BD find themselves inside an ancient Zeffo Tomb looking for messages from Cordova...
The deadly training room of the Inquisitorius, where Inquisitors and Purge Troopers hone their lethal skills. Through a merciless indoctrination of combat and strength, the sinister agents of the Empire prepare for their sworn mission. The fear-based, dark and abusive nature of this training is diametrically opposed to that of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
The double-bladed lightsaber excels at crowd control. Use the Force attack to overwhelm and clear large groups.
The highly dangerous Nydak Alpha is a reclusive yet relentless beast. Dominant over its lesser kind, this carnivorous alpha predator balances strength and intelligence to defend against multiple parries. Its muscular forearms are reinforced with a resistant hide over hardened, nutrient-enriched bone, making them versatile to climbing, asymmetrical traversal, and unable to be severed.
The hydraatis grows in dry, rocky areas. Air is filtered through its filaments, which trap dust and bacteria. Once filtered, the filaments contract to lock clean air inside, creating a humid environment where the hydraatis can absorb the small amount of water it needs to survive. 
The jotaz is a formidable and highly aggressive predator that utilizes brute strength to establish supremacy. A thick hide provides armor-like defensive support but vulnerabilities may exist along the abdomen region where the skin is thinnest. What this creature lacks in speed is supplemented by forceful blows and an impressive reach of long forearms.
The lesser nydak is a feared opponent for Nightbrothers, though legends say some Nightsisters kept them as familiars. Nydaks are solitary creatures, rarely seen in packs after adolescence. Their only natural predator is the massive Gorgara.
The memory of Jaro Tapal, Cal's deceased Master, still haunts the former Padawan. An imposing Lasat, Jaro Tapal served the Republic with distinction during the Clone Wars.
The menacing Purge Trooper serves the Galactic Empire's Inquisitorius Program to hunt down survivors of the treasonous Jedi Order. A specialized class of Imperial soldier trained and equipped with a variety of weapons and tactics, this elite group is few in number and keeps out of the public eye. Most citizens of the Empire are unaware they even exist. Of the Purge Trooper ranks, many are trained in melee combat using an Electrobaton, proving an agile and deadly nemesis.
The menacing mykal is an opportunistic flying predator known for sweeping attacks from the sky. Long considered a delicacy among Wookiee elders which maintained equilibrium within the species, their numbers have flourished under Imperial occupation. A nimble, aerodynamic acrobat, the creature instinctively avoids retaliation from prey with a balance of cunning grace and deadly skill.
The most common offerings brought to Miktrull's Tomb were votive candles, generally encased in metal and adorned with carvings. It's said that their flames represented Miktrull's unending power.
The partisans were forced to flee. The Empire drove them back, into the Shadowlands. I hope they made it.
The partisans were pinned down here. They were eventually overrun and had to retreat. They suffered heavy casualties.
The pesky flame beetle is a flying insectoid known for its bioluminescent, combustible posterior. These creatures synthesize chemicals derived from local flora into a highly flammable derivative. Extreme caution should be exercised when in close proximity.
The rare Oggdo Bogdo is a fiendishly formidable abomination, even deadlier than its common relative. This hyper aggressive predator attacks with ferocity, constantly maneuvering toward its prey to inflict greater injury at close range. The creature's speed and stamina are unmatched, making it difficult to parry or strike its lightsaber-resistant shell straight on.
The remains of a Zeffonian laborer. They were overworked to the point of death.
The remains of a stormtrooper. Killed when the tunnel collapsed due to Imperial excavation.
The remains of a villager who died trying to save his family from the Empire.
The remains of an Imperial officer who attempted to hide a relic in the cave. During a collapse, she was trapped and died.
The remains of ancient artifacts, deliberately destroyed for some purpose.
The remains of ancient wares crafted by the Zeffo. Perhaps used for rituals.
The retreating Partisans were ultimately rescued from Imperial forces by the Wookiee Chieftain Tarfful.
The saava is a snake-like flora primarily located in the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk. Parasitic by nature, they are capable of slowly extending the length of their body toward prey within reach or close contact. Their vine-like skin is resistant to any laceration and upon contact, will attach itself to a host, supplying themselves with nutrients for months or sometimes years. They are slow at expanding and quick to retract at any signs of danger.
The sardonic Ninth Sister joins the Second Sister in hunting for Cal Kestis on Bracca. A powerful Dowutin, the Ninth Sister's presence creates terror wherever she goes - a fact she relishes. 
The security systems within the Fortress are a complex network controlling bridges, wings, gates and portals. By employing a multi-tier fail-safe structure, the Empire controls every corner of the facility, providing immediate response to any breach. If necessary, the entire fortress may be purposely compromised or flooded to prevent the escape of prisoners.
The sinister Imperial Probe Droid, also known as a Probot, was an exploration and reconnaissance unit deployed by the Galactic Empire. This lightly-armored probe is equipped with six manipulator arms extending from a central pod and several retractable sensor arms for gathering samples. High resolution receivers and sensors cover the central brain core, including motion, acoustic, sonic, and seismic sensors, a radiation meter, magnetic imager, and holocamera. It carries an atmosphere sensor and hovers on a repulsorlift generator capable of maneuvering most terrain. Its primary directive is recon and surveillance of potential threats to the Empire, including insurgents, fugitives, and specialized targets.
The skull of an ancient Zeffo killed during a horrific disaster millennia ago.
The structure of these bones suggests a large reptilian creature. An analysis of elements within the bones date them as old as 1000 years.
The tach is a tree-dwelling primate native to the planet Kashyyyk. These friendly creatures can often be found on the ground searching for overripe fruits.
The vile Bane Back Spider is a venomous foe to be reckoned with. Primarily a hole dweller, they are known to skitter and climb with agility. When encountered, they can project venomous saliva at enemies with a range of up to twelve meters. Caution should be taken if they are killed due to emission of a toxic acid that will pool out from the corpse upon death.
The wanderer is revealed to be Taron Malicos, a former Jedi now in hiding. Betrayed by his own troopers during Order 66, he crashed on Dathomir where he succumbed to darkness and madness. Seeking a return to power, he has manipulated Merrin and the Nightbrothers in an effort to learn the secrets of their magick.
Their shield protects against lightsaber attacks, but only when activated.
There is also a workbench in the back of the Mantis.
There was a battle aboard the ship, forcing it to fall out of hyperspace and crash on this planet.
There was a special connection between the Wookiees and their forest.
These Nightsisters never got a proper burial. We're walking in a graveyard.
These excavation saws were specifically designed to cut through planetary bedrock, giving the Empire access to secrets thousands of kilometers below the surface.
These high-voltage electricity conduits once powered the Venator's engines. Capable of generating up to 1 gigaton of energy each, Republic safety precautions required there be no living entities in the area while they were operational.
These monuments once served as landmarks and memorials for the departed. The Villagers on Zeffo possessed deep respect for the dead, acknowledging that their struggles enabled the survival of the living. It's possible these stone sculptures were inspired by ancient Zeffo architecture. 
These relics contain materials that aren't native to Bogano. Their fragile structure indicates they were purely decorative, potentially objects of religious significance. It's possible they were carried here as a form of pilgrimage. <cf>
These scraps served as cairns for the droids who helped build the research station on Bogano. Without their help, little would be known about the Zeffo or their Vault.
These specialized Imperial flamethrowers have been modified to more effectively incinerate Kashyyyk's wildlife. 
These statues were carved from the natural cavern walls. They depict Zeffo holding spheres - possibly the same kind used to power their tombs.
These water filters rely on the planet's algae to purify drinking water. Impurities are removed by the algae and used as fuel to create water and minerals in a process known as chemosynthesis. The result converts the water's natural acids into drinkable water.
This Wookiee died from toxic poisoning. One of the many side effects from the refining process. The Empire is slowly destroying everything on this planet.
This ancient Zeffo sarcophagus holds the remains of Sage Eilram. They were the first of the Zeffo to establish a relationship with the inhabitants of Kashyyyk, and loved the planet's greenery dearly. Now, their remains are forever interred beneath the roots of a stone wroshyr tree.

This ship crashed long ago, but there was a survivor, someone who understood the Force. Most likely a Padawan. He was injured.
This station was abandoned. Imperial patrols used it as a checkpoint. It must have been overrun at some point by dangerous animals in the area.
This statue was placed carefully on a site with a view of the Vault. An indication that the ancients here chose the location of the Vault with great purpose.
This structure has been here for centuries. It appears the only way to open the Vault is by using the Force.
This trooper was ruthlessly killed by Saw Gerrera. Remind me not to get on his bad side.

Transmission
Trapped by the infamous Sorc Tormo, Cal and BD were forced to fight fearsome creatures. During the show, the Mantis burst into the Haxion Brood's lair to rescue them. The reunion was an unhappy one, however. Cal learned the Brood found him because Greez lied about paying off his debts. Even worse, Cal was still reeling from his discovery that Cere had given up Trilla under torture. Cere and Cal's argument was cut short by a transmission from Mari Kosan, who'd found Tarfful in Kashyyyk's Shadowlands...

While descending into Kashyyyk's atmosphere, the Mantis crew became embroiled in a skirmish between Imperial forces and freedom fighters. Believing Wookiee Chieftain Tarfful could be among them, Cal jumped ship and hijacked an AT-AT, piloting it right into the infamous insurgent Saw Gerrera! Saw and his fighters were in the middle of a campaign to liberate a nearby wroshyr sap refinery. With the possibility that Tarfful could be one of the Wookiees detained there, Cal and BD-1 agreed to help him.

While it was true that the Empire was closing in on the Tomb of Miktrull, Cal rushed to Zeffo to find himself caught in a trap laid by the Second Sister. She revealed herself to be Trilla, Cere's former Padawan. After a perilous battle, Trilla seemed to get the upper hand on Cal but before she could strike him down, BD-1 intervened - positioning an unbreakable laser field between Trilla and Cal. As Cal escaped into Miktrull's Tomb, he tried to call Cere but was interrupted by Trilla slicing his comm.

Wyyyschokk Attack
Wyyyschokk Eggs
Wyyyschokks are highly intelligent, multi-legged predators. They are found to be extremely aggressive to most sentient life forms, and known to cast an adhesive enzyme that incapacitates their prey in a web-like stasis, allowing them to strike with their sharp and venomous fangs. Wisely outsmarting any foe, they often lower quickly from forest canopies, or burrow to the surface from underground cover. If possible, prey should avoid any web strike, but if caught, fight to escape before the wyyyschokk closes in. Their hostility may provide strategic opportunities for a surprise attack from behind. Although capable of quick maneuvering, they occasionally find themselves susceptible to strikes in the head or appendages.
